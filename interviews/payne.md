First off, thank you very much for taking the time to chat with me this morning. I really appreciate it. As you can imagine, I send out these messages and they're sponsored. It's super low. So every time someone does respond, I'm just very thankful. So thank you. I'll try to be respectful of your time and not take more than, like, 15 minutes or so.  
Them: Oh, no, no, no. You're good. Because this is an interesting topic on multiple levels.

Me: So. I am like, okay. I'm intrigued by this. Okay. All right.  
Them: And everything, so I'm curious.  
Me: And everything, so I'm curious.  
Them: Where you're going with it.  
Me: Where are you going? With it. Yeah. Let me just give you a quick overview of kind of. I try to keep this brief because I could just talk and talk and talk, but I've been in.  
Them: We're both good. I can do that here and just ramble.  
Me: We're both good. Here in. Just ramble. Okay, cool. So just quick about me. For the past. Most of the past 25 years, I followed the normal plan that society lays out for you, right? Climb the corporate ladder, start entry level. Like climb, climb, climb, climb, climb. About 10 years ago I reached the VP level and was a VP of product at a bunch of health tech startups. For about a decade. About a year and a half ago, I got laid off. Didn't think that was a big deal. A year and a half go by. I applied to over 1,500 jobs, didn't have a single offer from that, and started looking at the market as a whole, being like, something's not right here. What the hell is going on? Realize that I'm just one of many, many, many people feeling the same exact thing that I've been dealing with. I ended up reaching a point where I posted what's becoming the most common thing ever now is these desperate pleas on LinkedIn. Right? I ended up going viral on LinkedIn, got picked up by Business Insider. They did a profile on me. And ended up because of that. Got connected with some people here in my community that run a venture studio, which is essentially a company that starts companies. And one of the company ideas that they're working on is something in this space which is related to fixing what's broken about professional networking. So, meaning, like, all we really have is LinkedIn, and LinkedIn is performative and everyone ghosts and it's not real. There's no real human connection happening on LinkedIn for the most part. Right. So what we're toying around with is this idea of bringing community relationships back together. And coming up with a system that can connect people meaningfully. And we're kind of in the early stages of that, and I think we all have enough insight into what the problems that people face are. But we want to talk to some real people and just get some real feedback from people to say, what are you experiencing? What are your pain points? To make sure that what were the path that we're on is the right one. So that's kind of like the elevator pitch, I guess. Maybe extend a later pitch of what we're working on and why this conversation came to be. Make sense.  
Them: Got it? Yep. 100%.  
Me: Yep, 100%. All right. Yeah, I'd love to hear about you. Where are you in this whole thing? Oh, just one more thing.  
Them: So go ahead.  
Me: I found you because we're both in the executive career upgrades slack community. That's how I found you. So I figured you might fit the profile based on being in that community alone. And that's why I reached out to you, so I'll give you that context.

Me: But what's going to stage you out is the ability to have people, somebody to reach out to and have a conversation that it could be done in 10 minutes compared to 24 to 48 hours. Done. Yeah. It sounds like you have a pretty. I would call it an atypical network, where I think that a lot of people have their networks on their LinkedIn connections. They have a thousand LinkedIn connections, but they never met any of them. Right. Or very few of them. Or it feels like a lot of your network are. People that you have meaningful relationships with. Even if you're not talking to them on a regular basis, there's still people that you can call when you need something. So it's like, I wonder when you need something that's not obvious to anyone in your network. Right? You need someone who's specialized. In this one area that you just don't know anybody, how would you find that person today? How would you go find that person?  
Them: So for me personally, I would start with my network as a whole.

Them: And not just be frantic about it because you don't have a normal, regular paycheck coming in from corporate America, per se.  
Me: And not just in forensic about it because you don't have a normal regular paycheck coming in for a corporate America right now. I would reach out to somebody.  
Them: Now I would reach out to somebody I knew and asked for a referral or connections. What that was.  
Me: I knew and ask. For. Referral or connections. What that was.  
Them: In that space because my network is quite large.  
Me: In that. Space because my network is quite large.

Me: When we're talking about just some of the stuff I'm getting involved in and now meeting leaders on the level that I'm doing. Across. That, then there's not anybody that I. Can find.  
Them: I'll just say that.  
Me: I'll just say that. Right. Yeah, you're a great example of the power of a network that actually works the way that it's supposed to. But I guess I'm wondering from that perspective, knowing that a lot of people don't experience it the same way that you do, what do you see as, hey, if this tool existed to do this. That would be something that I think that people would benefit from. Do you have any kind of low hanging fruit that you're like, man, this thing really sucked and really nothing out there that solves that problem?  
Them: I would agree with that. So you talk about an industry, so look at industries as a whole. Now we can get into the logistics of. Do you want to do a subscription?  
Me: I would agree with that. So you talked about an industry, so look up industries as a whole. Now we can get into the logistics of. Do you want to pay to a subscription?  
Them: Or anything, but you need a group of leaders.  
Me: Or anything, but you need a group of leaders that will be able to be available or somewhat available, reached out to or even emailed to be able to connect with and what that looks like.  
Them: That will be able to be available or somewhat available, reached out to or even emailed to be able to connect with and what that looks like. And knowing we're all busy, we're all got stuff going on, but making time for.  
Me: And. No one will. Always. Got stuff going on. But making time for.  
Them: Everything else. I think for me, personally, I'm in that place where I'm still building a lot of things and connecting.  
Me: Everything. Else. I think. For me personally. I'm in that place. Where? I'm still building a lot. Of things. And connecting.  
Them: But in the same breath, I feel like it's also a time to give back.  
Me: But in the same bread. I feel like it's also a time to get back.  
Them: In the same breath. Because now in today's world, you have a group of people, young adults, even middle aged individuals, men and women, because of technology, that are going to struggle in trying to find where their identity is and who they are, what they want to do.  
Me: In the same breath. Because now, in today's world, You have a. Group of people, young adults, even middle aged individuals, men and women, because of technology that are. Going to struggle in trying to find where their identity is and who they are, what they want to do.  
Them: If there's a tool.  
Me: If there's a tool.  
Them: That can bring industry leaders in.  
Me: That. Can bring industry leaders in.  
Them: Be available, however that is, or be at least be able to be contacted by.  
Me: Be available. However. That is, or be at least able to be contacted by.  
Them: Two. And now you're talking on a level that you need to get these leaders buy in, but also understand they were in the same position. They struggled just as well.  
Me: Two. And now you're talking on the level that you need to get these leaders buy in, but also understand they were in the same position. They struggled just as well.
