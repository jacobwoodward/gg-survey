Transcript:
 
Them: Very much because there's a clear need in terms of people's connection with people and LinkedIn, and it's just totally fubar, right? So I really like it now. That said, I do want to kind of go back to what you said earlier about the ub, whatever. The private networks for the ub, the big thing that comes to mind. For me is that one of the hardest pain points? Is to drive better engagement. Right? Is to drive better engagement from people. Because most people are just going to give up. Like, they're not going to engage because we already live in a super noisy world. In order for us to drive engagement. There has to be some very, very specific value. That good growth brings to the table. And I think we need to spend time thinking about that very carefully, and it needs to be very prescriptive. I think the AI capability of facilitation is more of a feature. Right. But there. There's got to be, like, one, two, three things. That is critical. So let me just give you one example which is not related to this.  
Me: Sure.  
Them: But you know, so many companies that do marketing automation. Like, for small businesses, they'll. They'll give this rich email editor and pathways and blah, blah, blah, whatever, right? And like, like 90% of these businesses. Like they just want to send a happy birthday. Campaign. Or like, hey, here's 20% off. It's your birthday here. Or, here's a free coffee. Or here's. Or like, you haven't come to our store. In, like, two months. Here's 10%. Come back to our store. Just. That's it. That's all they want to do. They don't want to go into email and like, you know, all the email pathways and blah, blah, blah. Right. Send up, like, deal with. So there should be like. Ideally, they should be like one radio button. Birthday campaign turned on? Yes. One radio button. Missing in action, but, you know, campaign like. I'm just giving you an example, right? That's what small businesses would find value versus us trying to sell them. Hey, you know, we have these fields like what I did at gridc. We have these awesome fields that we track on the user and the birthday field and the last customer visit date field. And they're like, you already lost it. Start fucking. Done right. That's my only thing. So I think we need to spend more time thinking about what is the value proposition. What? What itch? What pain? Does good growth show solve versus the vitamin? Like, how do we turn good growth into a painkiller? Versus limit. That's what we need to really think about. So why don't you walk me through the deck?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Absolutely.  
Them: But. But that was the first thing that came to my mind. And so I really wanted to, you know, I really wanted to get right into it. So we can skip over this slide, right? It makes sense.  
Me: This is high level of being refined. Right. So this is really the initial customer profile that we'd be targeting. We'll call them the program director. This might be someone at university.  
Them: Totally.  
Me: This might be someone at 43 north or Tech Buffalo. They essentially are running a program to help people develop themselves, whether it's entrepreneurial or otherwise. And really what their challenge is is they have people willing to help. Peers or mentors, and they have zero visibility into even if they're connecting. Right. Is the meeting even happening? No idea. They got to survey it, run into people in the hall. Otherwise, beyond that. They have no understanding of the quality of the engagement. Right. What did Raj and Jonathan talk about? And is it something that is furthering my goals? Right. So program director's pain, I think, is the clearest kind of validated this a bit with mentoredc. And then obviously the individuals and the employers underneath that have deep, deep pains, right, for the individuals, the talent, if you will. They're in this synthetic deadlock of resumes and applying. They make their perfect AI resume, and that gets fed to an AI ats and nobody ever hears anything, right?  
Them: Right.  
Me: So those are kind of the initial pains that we are looking to solve. This kind of synthetic facade that the world is dealing with right now.  
Them: I really like that. I really like that analogy. Synthetic facade. Very cool. It's nice. Okay? I. This is a real problem. I. I totally agree. Right. I completely agree. We've all run into this, and I'm sure you talk to. Who's that new. The new CEO of Tech Buffalo.  
Me: Oh, Geoffrey. Yeah, I just got out of a session with him. So he's very interested in this product.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then you go to any of the career services at ub.  
Me: Exactly.  
Them: And they'll be interested in this, too. And then you go to, like, Roscoe. Oh, wait. He quit mnt, though. Right.  
Me: Oh, yeah. Roscoe's at Tech Buffalo now, right?  
Them: Yeah, Roscoe's a type Buffalo. Yeah, yeah, sorry he quit. Yeah, but whoever took over. But cool. So let's. Let's keep going. So.  
Me: Yeah. So essentially, right. Like, everything is big and broad and performative. Right. Likes and impressions. Right. And it's not that deep work that humans need. Right. And so the thesis here is that it's not about having 5,000 followers. It's having five people that you could be super vulnerable with and be like, I am struggling here, and that person sitting across from the table from you or the meeting from you is going to give you that hard truth. And the feedback via, you know, mentorship. Right. To help you level up. Now, the key here, and you kind of touched on this in the beginning, is like, people have to give a shit about getting better. They have to want to go through that struggle and the pain that is usually involved in getting to the next level in life.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Just. Sad truth, though, Jonathan, between you and me, we. We both know this. That the vast majority of the people are either overwhelmed. Or they don't give a. Or they don't give a. And they try and then they stop trying after a little bit.  
Me: Very much. So very much.  
Them: And then there's a very small sliver of people that actually, like, make this part of a system. So part of a ritual that they go through. Before we go further, do you. Who. Who's going to be writing the check for this? Who do you think that is?  
Me: As far as the customer. This, I believe, is the program director. And that could be university incubator, accelerator or the employer.  
Them: Yeah. Do you think? Do you think people like David Schwab, whatever his name is. Do you know who I'm talking about?  
Me: I believe so.  
Them: Really tall guy.  
Me: Yeah, yeah.  
Them: Do you think people like him? That are like pseudo career coaches. There's a lot of them.  
Me: Very much so.  
Them: Do you think they could be a good. You know, customer. For this.  
Me: I do. And I like intentionally kind of put them aside for now just to create some clarity in who we're talking to. But absolutely. The coaching market, right. From the folks that I talk to late last year, they all have this problem. They can do one to one sessions like this. Sure. But then how do you actually reach people, and it's usually through one to many style, you know, mastermind groups or mentorship. So they would absolutely be, you know, a Persona that would see a lot of value from this.  
Them: This. Okay? Should we keep going?  
Me: Let's do it.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Right? So I, you know, I talked a lot about this, but it's these hyper, local, deep interactions that, that people are really interested in. Right? Not the fake resume, not the fake profile, not the fake, you know, person they asked to recommend them on the profile. Right. It's really these soft skills and behavioral signals that. People want.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Right. This is the employer. You know, talking to the folks at Odoo and people at UB said, how do you identify top talent? Right. And it's all. They literally say things like, grit, follow through. Do they show up?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Do the, you know, how do they speak and, and do they articulate what they're interested in? Do they have a curiosity? So my thesis behind this is really we build the system to extract that from the human through a gentic conversations that SMS, etc. And we build the new living record of everything under the surface.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. I mean. You know, at grit seed. I tried to build what's called the grit profile. You know? Because I realized. I realized that the vast majority of the employers that will use us. They? The gold is in the data of the people. That are on the platform versus anything else and if I really want to. But it was too late for me because anyways, that if I had, let's say, a database of a hundred thousand people with grit, that would be a very different conversation when I went to different companies. Versus Let me show you software that allows you to do XYZ because they don't want more software. They want people with grit. Right. And so the network. Is going to be really key. And I think them taught me this. I remember three years ago, and he told me he's like Raj in any marketplace situation. And. And this is not really a marketplace, but it kind of is.  
Me: Kind of, yeah.  
Them: Yeah, you know, like the supply is where you start. So what we got to ask ourselves here, Perhaps. Perhaps right? Is what can we do to get 90 plus percent of UB students on good Growth?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And if we can get 90 plus plus percent of students on good growth. Well, we know they want jobs. There's. There's more students that are doing their jobs. They're going to. And if we can clearly tell them that, look, we're going to help you. Not just build a fake resume. We're actually going to help you build meaningful connections with people that are hiring. And we want you to go through this process. When this process is not going to be some. Some pseudo process that like, hey, you're going to write a cover letter or you're going to take this assessment. But it's going to be like a six month process. It's like a six month courting process. And during that process, we're going to go through. Engagement with you. We're going to go through interactions with you, we're going to teach you, we're going to guide you. We're going to, you know. We're going to help you bring your give a shit meter up. Okay? Because that's what employers are looking for. And if you follow the process, And this agentic layer that we've built. Then you know on the other side you will. You will. Not only will you be better prepared. Or better represented. Through some layer that we can build. Right, but, like, you'll be better prepared, even in general. In just learning how the professional world really works. And in a world where. You know, information is no longer. The. You know, the differentiator. In a world where now with AI opportunities no longer the differentiator because everybody. If you can. It's execution that's the real differentiator. Now. This is going to help you set yourself apart from the 10,000 other people. That are looking for those five or ten jobs.  
Me: That's exactly right. You're hitting the nail on the head. Right. And we. We believe that if you do these things, if you engage with our agent over time, And show up in the community and meet the right people. The invitations to the jobs come to you. So we're flipping this recruiting model on its own. I want my entire career. I think I had to show my resume one time, right? And it's because I was in the right circles, talking to the right people, and the opportunities came to me.  
Them: Yeah. Exactly. I love that.  
Me: What was flipping.  
Them: It's. And. And I think. You know, we can get really clever. In how we approach just with college students. For the boys. It can be if you. If you stop chasing the girl, the girl will come to you. Because if you focus on yourself, It's a bit like that opportunity to come to you and you can flip that also for the girls. Because we all know the more we chase, the less valuable we become. The less time we spend on ourselves, building ourselves. And if we truly focus on ourselves and building good skills, good character, good repeatable processes, Then we attract people that. Are more in tune with who we are as people. And it's really important. So I love that. That is 10,000% right, because everyone's in a, you know, an instant gratification. Everyone's in chase mode all the time.  
Me: That's right.  
Them: You just got to go to the one one of these bloody college fairs.  
Me: Exactly. Right? And it's all, you know, we had the one downstairs here, and it was, you know. Hundreds of people all saying the same thing, handing me a sheet of paper. Right? And I thought, this. This is madness, right? And it's like that's how they're fishing right now. Job boards and applications and cover letters. Like, you need to be in a different pond.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: And this is the kind of radical shift that I see happening.  
Them: Yeah. So we do need to think about this. That layer. In detail. And I'm sure you, you're going to go through that. But that is very important, right, to keep these people, like, motivated, engaged and gamified, et cetera, et cetera. But keep going, yeah.  
Me: Yeah. So super high level, right? This is done through mentorship. Meeting the right people masterminds, small groups of people working on the hardest problems. And then this idea of the agent, right? So imagine you're an actor and your agent calls you and says, hey, you know, based on your last roles, right? Like, you know. Here are some things that I'm thinking about and oh no, you're not a good fit for that role. You're better off here, right? And you're not going to have a one time call. This thing's going to call you maybe once a month, like a friend. It might SMS you it. Might call you and build your unique record in this profile through ambient technology, through technology that you're already in, not another app, right? Your phone, your sms. And this ultimately, you know, generates some of this data that we need to build the profile and what people want to see in the world. Right? When you go to UB Student, you say, hey, you know, are you sick of, you know, sending out hundreds of resumes and hearing nothing? This is a new way to be discovered here, constrained to Buffalo. And by conversing with this agent in this system, we're going to build a unique record that's going to show how you stand out and likely get you into these intentional invitations into internships, jobs, etc.  
Them: Yeah. So I do think this is where the rubber meets the road. And I do think we need to take, take go really deep here. Because I think this is really. We need to create a message that's going to resonate with the people, the students, and a message that's going to resonate with the employers. That. You know, we have this gold layer. You know, and the obvious thing is the agents are incredibly powerful because now they can start to have these meaningful conversations without humans being involved. And collecting metadata. That's going to help everybody. Right. But I think we need to go really deep here. Because this is what's going to separate this solution from everything else.  
Me: Yeah, that's a good note. I have a. I have a lot of very intricate thoughts on, you know, how, how this experiment would run. But I agree, you know, going, going deep here and essentially making sure the humans engaged, changing that human behavior becomes the, the first validation point. Can we get humans to engage with one another? And build this new record.  
Them: Yeah. And I would, in order for you to go deep, what I would suggest we do. Is. We go to people that are doing a lot of hiring or that have hired a lot of people. First. We ask them? We're going to help you build a supply of these amazing people. I want you to walk me through. You know, what is your process and how you're assessing these people that you're hiring today? And everyone will have Some people will tell you oh, I use this disk profiles and some people tell you all by hire sports people Some people will tell you. I hire people that only go to top schools. Some people tell you I never hire people that go to top schools. Blah, blah, blah, whatever that is. The point is that feedback is extremely valuable for that metadata layer. And. That's. And the reason why that's so valuable, obviously, is because they're the ones who will be making the hiring decisions. But that will be the basis with which we build the engagement layer with the students. With the career professionals who are going to be part of this, you know, mastermind community. And. I think. If. If we can, you know, clearly understand that from the employers. That are going to bring value to this. And then we translate that and share that message with, you know, let's say the students be like, look, we have. You know, hundreds of employers that want to hire. You're sick and tired of submitting your resumes. We have real people that want to hire, but they don't want to hire through this traditional res. They want to get to know you. They want to understand you. They want to get to engage with you. They want to see how you work in certain situations. And good growth. You know, like, we have to ask ourselves, Jonathan, like, you know, what the start of this conversation, like, the question we asked ourselves, like, what is that tangible use case is that? Is that recruiting? Is that going to be their tangible use case? That's a great use case in terms of everyone's. Everyone always wants the best people and it's a really easy sell. You want best people? Of course I want best people. Great sign up. It's a very easy sell. The whole mastermind type of development, that's a much harder sell. Oh, shit. How much time will I have to contribute? Oh, this person, this agent is going to just message me on my own time. Yeah, but still, you know, I'm always. I have, like, 6,000 unread messages, and I'm like. You know, I'm like, oh, I was traveling and I got going on, you know. You know, there's always some, you know, and. And.  
Me: Right.  
Them: So just something to think about. Like, what is that? Sure. The ultimate objective here is we're creating, you know, highly, highly engaged metadata. We're creating something that breaks the chains of the people are stuck in, okay? And. But that has to mean that we're all going to have dinner together because we're working towards dinner. You know, and that dinner is. Is that tangible use case, you know, so that's just my two cents so far. But from what we're talking, Right. Okay, but we keep going.  
Me: Let's keep rocking.  
Them: Okay? So how it works? Perfect. Let's jump in.  
Me: Yep. So, again, I touched on some of this. But, you know, you, you text a number to join and it asks you a few questions and it immediately builds your profile on the the web. Right. But you're just SMSing and then it's going to call you, right? It's going to say, hey, I'M going to give you a call over the next week or so and you're going to have a three to five minute conversation to learn about, you know, what company you're at, how many years you have an experience and what are your general kind of interests and goals. Right. Again. Another layer on this new profile. Right from there we have a set of people. Let's say that we're going to start to introduce to one another, whether it's in a group setting or a mentorship setting. Now, this can be through group SMS or it can be through real world experiences. Hey, go meet. I'm getting some people. Who are interested in AI at Spot Coffee Tuesday at 9am like, are you interested? And so then it takes that information of the profile connects the folks, and then again, that agent is going to follow up again after. Now you have these real world experiences that need to be captured so that we can have that metadata. So it would do the follow up kind of quote, survey or questionnaire, hey, how did it go? Did you end up going? No. Okay, why not? And it's going to ultimately validate that you were there or not. Again, continuing to build out your living record. And ultimately, it's a series of those engagements through the agent over time, that's going to continue to build that out, connect you to the right people and to have you receive those intentional invites to internships, jobs, etc.  
Them: Right.  
Me: So super high level, I'm sure.  
Them: Yeah. I love this. I love this. I think. I think it is important. A couple of things, right? I think you should also write down, like, how are we going to measure. Like when we engage with these people. Like these agents called like, what are the KPIs? You know, how are we going to measure the level of engagement? Like, for example, when we call it, are they returning the call or are they texting back? Are they. Are there responses terse? Are they, you know, do they feel like they're talking to some random AI? When is the trust being established between the agent and the person? Right. That's very important because. You know? Not trust is what's going to drive more engagement from the students, from the young professionals and so on. That's really key.  
Me: It is.  
Them: Think about that. Right. Because the last thing I want to do is. Okay, fine, sure. I got this call, and then I do my thing, and then I just stop. Or does Agent tries to connect me with someone and, like, I don't respond. Right. And so that trust between the agent and the people is going to be mission critical. Now you can the good news is I think we can probably add a human layer to it where the human can. Start.  
Me: Can you hear me?  
Them: Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry. Hold on one second, please. One second. I. I was just. The developer I work with, he's on another call. One second.  
Me: All good.  
Them: Yeah. Okay? I'm back. Sorry about that.  
Me: No worries.  
Them: For some reason, Supabase, like, just will randomly just die on us, like, we have to.  
Me: I don't like pause your instance or some weird.  
Them: Yeah, I don't know what it does. And we have to, like, randomly go in and restart. Otherwise we can't do any deployments, we can't do any migrations.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So.  
Me: So trust, right?  
Them: Trust is key. Think about this very carefully. Because we want to keep them engaged. We don't want them thinking they're talking to some random AI. And. And also, like, you know, the world we live in now, right? Everyone's like, no one's really interested in the process. Everyone's interested in, like, finishing and, like, you know, a long survey, like, how many people are going to fill that out? Like, we need to think about this.  
Me: Quick wins. Right.  
Them: Like very carefully. Because. This is where the sausage is going to be made. And I think these are the types of details that's going to help us determine whether good growth. Like, gets that traction or not, right? It's a bit like that Duolingo model, right, Like. They put a lot of effort into, like, getting people. You know, engaged, right? And.  
Me: Building that habit, right?  
Them: Yeah. That's really hard, and you and I both know that, right? So. But, yeah, that's my two cents here. So let's keep going.  
Me: Totally agree as well. Right. A lot of details to go on there.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But here we go. Right, so again, for version one, it's about this verified, reportable engagement, right? Who met what was discussed? What was the quality of the engagement? Does this person have follow through? Are they booking multiple sessions with the same mentor and actually showing up? You know, what is their progress over time? That's one of the things that stands out, that is very important, but very hard to track, which is how has the mentor sessions or group sessions affected my career trajectory? Now if we solve that, this is a billion dollar company, but it is a challenge. And I think again, this voice agent SMS is a kind of unique thread through it all. If we can tie it.  
Them: Yeah. And we tired in a way where. It's very meaningful. Right. And. It's almost scientific. Right. Like we should probably consider hiring, like, a behavioral psychologist.  
Me: Absolutely. So Jeffrey at Tech Buffalo has a few people in mind already. Absolutely, yeah.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Thinking wavelength. I love it.  
Them: Cool. All right. Very nice. Should we keep going?  
Me: Sure. Okay, so again, the moats that exist, some of our thinking is that. We stay constrained to Buffalo to start so that we have that density. We have faster feedback loops for the product, and we rally behind the Buffalo Mafia, if you will. Right. It's four ounces. We're building it here. First we create the density, and ultimately then we replicate that into other cities. And ultimately, this gives us a very unique view on the talent and employers here in Buffalo.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: First, right?  
Them: Yeah. You know, the. The. The Scott Stencils of the world. Oops, Sorry. I restarted production. Work. Oh, sorry.  
Me: You definitely take care of that.  
Them: Yeah. One minute, please. I apologize. Let me just confirm that production is up, okay? Because obviously, Okay? Production is up. Yeah, production is good. Okay? Okay? Yeah. Okay. I. I like that. So I was saying, you know, the. The Randy Strauss is the stick of the Scott. Sten selects of the world. You know who are entrenched in. Network and connection and fruiting and so on. They're going to take this. They're going to be watching, okay?  
Me: Very much so.  
Them: Yeah. Because this is a threat to their model, right?  
Me: It is. It flips. A lot of it on its head.  
Them: Yeah. And when I was at Grit Seed, you know what he did, just so you were aware. He got me to go meet with him. And he's a good guy. Like, I don't have a problem with Scott. He's a good guy. You know, it was good. Like. I almost thought about selling gritcy to him, but I never had. Nothing really materialized. But he was keeping in tabs on what I was doing. And. I think their. Their approach to this is going to be, oh, we already have a company, because he owns, like, seven that are coming. Oh, we already have our own. I have a company that does this. And, you know, he throws the dollars, and so he becomes, like, the guy. With 43 North. But the good thing is we have people like Dan. On our side, and we can do cool things here.  
Me: Yes, I've already heard similar things. That are directly aligned to what you're saying.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: As Jeffrey, because Jeffrey is a big proponent of this concept, and he's having some of these conversations a lot like what you're hearing from the Elrond group.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Do you know fred? Fred gulo?  
Me: No.  
Them: What's his last name? Fred. No, frank. Sorry, frank.  
Me: Okay? Yeah.  
Them: Yeah, sorry. Frank.  
Me: I don't know if I'm connected. To him.  
Them: He's a good guy. So you could talk to him, too. But Scott's going to get involved for sure.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Okay. Go to market. Flywheel, let's go.  
Me: Yeah, this is, again, like, you know, the program director at a university incubator, et cetera. They buy, right? The technology, and then they invite the people in. So Hadar over at ub, she invites in all the students. Part of the Western New York Prosperity Fellows. And, you know, puts mentors in the group as well. But there are buyer, right? They adopt, invite people. Again, you have our technology facilitating and getting those signals out of it. And ultimately, you take that model and say, look at what we've done here, right through university and nonprofit groups, whatever. And now say, okay. Hey, employer, do you want to create these mastermind groups? Within your organization to have better mentorship visibility to that and ultimately create, you know, a bigger Venn diagram that extends outside of, let's say, M and T to now identify top talent through these engagement sources. So that's generally what we're thinking about here.  
Them: Okay? Have you watched the nfx podcast?  
Me: I love nfx, but I read everything. I've not listened to the podcast.  
Them: Well, they have, like, you know, they, they have. All those episodes on their, you know, on their podcast, I think. Yeah.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And. I'm gonna. I'll. I'll kind of just do a refresher, but I think. I think it would be very helpful to go back and just kind of. Think about what. What they're saying, because there is a huge network effect here, obviously. If we do this right.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: And something to think about. Is the people that. Are in this process is part of this mastermind. You know they're going to become. They're going to become the future recruiters. That come into this, you know, good growth program. Just like how, you know, Vistage and EO and so on, they actually hold their members accountable on how many people they can recruit. That's something to think about. But once you get these people that are super engaged, you know, super connectors or super, you know, helpers, we. We need to think about how we enable them. Because they're driven, not based on, like, money. You know, these people are driven based on, you know, wherever they are, usually later part of their life. They're different based on impact. They're based on, like, in many ways. There's information on power. They're, you know, driven based on status et cetera. Et cetera. And something we have to think about. But nfx. I would. I would definitely. I would. I'll read that again. I'll watch that a couple of episodes. I know there comes some that come to my mind, but yeah.  
Me: Yeah. I'm going to check out the, the podcast. And I, I like what you're saying about, you know what, these people maybe later in their career who are not financially motivated, really out of this. Right. And again, we do hear signals around, like, impact, influence.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Right towards the community that they're involved in. What's interesting. So Vistage typically has a paid chair, and they become the facilitator and they're compensated. Whereas EO is more about the peer model. But EO does training for everybody that comes in to they become a facilitator and something else like a listener. Right. So they actually take turns being facilitators in each one of their masterminds. But a lot of insight to be to be garnered. From that.  
Them: Yeah. Definitely.  
Me: And that that alone, like the mastermind market, is a massive, massive multibillion dollar market.  
Them: Yeah. You know another thing, Jonathan, that I think could be valuable, you know? Buffalo business first creates a list of, like, the top 250 people. You know? In buffalo, right? We could approach them. All of them. And be like, hey, would you like to be. Like a mentor into this good growth model building. And the coolest thing about that. Right is. They? Because I think there's a reason why they would be more inclined to be because, number one, they're recognized already and so they will hold their that stewardship. With high regard. So if we tell them, hey, we're gonna. We're gonna. We're compiling this network. Of people. And we're. We're. Our goal is to ultimately, you know, create a community effect where we're helping our community here in Buffalo. And we want you guys as the top 20, 250 people in Buffalo. To be a part of this community. So, you know, it inspires. You can inspire other people. You can mentor, you can engage. And our commitment to you is we're not going to add more to your plate. What we're going to do is X, Y, Z. Which will make this a lot. Manageable for you. It's not adding more work to your plate. You reward we. This is you, you know, accepting the responsibility that you have now. In our community, as, you know, key players in the community, and so something. And the good news is that's a very public list. And on that list. I know lots of people on that list. We can start just, like, reaching out to people. I mean, once they start messaging is Chris. Once our messaging is clear, the details are ironed out. I think it would be a very valuable way to get more people later on because now if we can say, hey, the top 250 people in Buffalo are on the Good Growth Network, Something to think about.  
Me: I really like that because the, the one other, you know, piece of feedback that I continually hear about mastermind groups is really the quality of the people matter. And if you put five, you know, C players in the same group, it's this echo chamber of mediocrity. Right. So you really do want these high performing individuals, right. Who are willing to go deep, and I think that list would be a great place to start.  
Them: Yeah. And if you can convince those five really good people that we're not adding more to their plate, We're actually enabling them. To take their responsibility. In stride. You know, then I think then there's something to say.  
Me: Yeah, absolutely. And even. Even talking to Dan about this concept, he struggles with this, right, because he's intro to people and they're like, who should I meet with? And he's got to take all these meetings that he doesn't know about, and it's a big pain. If we could take some of that admin off of him and have the technology facilitate, whether it's one to many, with Dan being the main mentor or otherwise, that could be really powerful.  
Them: Yes. Yeah.  
Me: Value. Spoke.  
Them: Yeah. Cool.  
Me: So, yeah, into the, into the model. Here again, program director is paying an annual SaaS fee, right. Per seat or otherwise moving to employers. Right. Where they're going to start to have that talent, intelligence, but ultimately reducing the pain of, of churn and the drastic need to upskill their employees. This allows them to do that through, you know, peer to peer or mentorship. And then even longer term, right? This is where you get into. What I'm excited about is these kind of premium memberships of elite mastermind groups, right? This is where people pay. You know, Vistage was something like 20 grand a year, and I know people who are in $100,000 a year groups, but. From our initial survey late last year. And we had, you know, 35 results or so. People were willing to pay 49 to 499amonth to be in these groups. So this is kind of how we see it staged out.  
Them: Yeah. And. And I think if we. If we can somehow get these program directors on board. We can then use the program directors to get the employers on board. Just like how universities, when they reach out to companies. About career fairs, and they say, hey, if you want a table, you need to pay $500. I think there's angles with the program directors. They already have connections. In the, in the community where we can almost use them as, like our.  
Me: Like a distribution partner.  
Them: Distribution. Chat. Yeah.  
Me: I like that.  
Them: Yeah. So something to think about. And one way to do that. Is like in a freemium model where. You know, if we are to revamp this whole job fair approach. You know, what can we do to. Share talent with these employers in a way where these employers are like, oh, kind of network effect, right? Like program directors are on. We need to get the employers on. And how do we share? Because today these employers, most of the time, they walk with stacks of resumes when they leave. That's terrible.  
Me: They're calling like that's how we're hiring at Radial. It's. Hey, Hadar, who's your top ML talent? Right in his right based on some of those soft skills that you see.  
Them: Yes. Yeah.  
Me: I like that idea. That's fantastic.  
Them: Yeah. Okay?  
Me: So, yeah, over, over the long term, it's a, it's a, you know, 100 billion dollar market again, starting with something very small, university programs, accelerators, even workforce development. Moving on to the larger kind of leadership and internal talent mobility at employers. Right. And then again moving out further into, you know, hiring hr, corporate learning and development. And again, that professional mastermind. I don't know that. I guess that is learning and development part of that, so.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. How many. How many of those program directors have you spoken to so far?  
Me: So actually, a lot. So our existing product mentored Deck. Talks to those folks today. So we have, you know, 300 some odd people in our CRM. We've ran cohorts all over the world. I mean our, our revenue somewhere around like 25k. ARR. So it's small but like Techstars uses it. There's folks in UAE, Portugal, Japan, United States, and these are all, like, literally, the program director, who have to prove that their mentorship is actually working.  
Them: Wow. Cool. Nice. So.  
Me: Yeah. So that's where you see some of these results here on the left hand side. Again, MentoredC is that first bullet. The mastermind survey was kind of good growth v1 and then more recent surveys over the past two weeks. Right. This is where we've talked to students. Program directors and employers. And this is kind of the data that we're seeing, right? That, that synthetic data, like, the student gets it right away. They're like, I'm totally. I'm going to graduate. I don't know how to get a job. And it is a black hole.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Right. We talked a lot about the zero interface. Stuff like not another app to manage and go to, but the ambient way of interacting. Super, super popular.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And, yeah, you know, the recruiters are also saying, like, we lose qualified people. Right. They're all slipping through the cracks, and I have no good way to identify them. So we're still early in our. In our conversations, but we're getting traction here. And what we're learning.  
Them: Y. Eah. Cool. Cool, cool.  
Me: Yeah, just a little bit of a. A vision statement. But we want to allow people to grow professionally. Right. And if you look at some of the stats from the World Economic Forum and how many, how many adult learners are continuing to learn, it's actually very dire. It's very scary that people are not growing professionally. And when, you know, by 2028, 50% of the workforce is going to have to be up skilled. We are in a very serious situation right now, and we believe the world needs the ability to go deep with people in their community and work on the hard stuff. And remove the superficial that we've been dealing with for the past 15 years or so.  
Them: Yeah, I agree. Completely. Yeah.  
Me: Here. I talked to some of this.  
Them: Y. Eah, cool. I think. Well, I'd love to also know what you think, how I can help you. But I think the details really like the, with these students, with the mastermind community type community that the good growth community, not the mentors, not the program directors, but like the actual community, the actual engagement, the actual trust formation. I think we need a lot of detail there. We need to spend a lot of time thinking about that. And then we need to spend a lot of time just kind of thinking about. Like, how do we get these. These. The two top 250 people, to engage or reduce their workflow? We're not adding more or making them stewards of the community. They're taking their responsibilities seriously. Mentorship and guidance and growth of the community. And almost like, you know, like when you go to an auction, you know, everyone wants to one up each other. You know, like, how do we create a. How do we create that mindset where, like. You know, like. Like, do we give them Top Network or badges? Do we give them mentors? Like, do we partner with Buffalo business first, where it's not just a list of 250 people. We start to, like, profile people that have gone out of their way to help. You know, 10, 20 people. And here's a quantifiable good growth metric that's first can partner with. You know, they're good growth score is X. You know, I'm just, I'm thinking, right, like, we need to, like we need to really think about these things in. In a lot. Of detail. And. I think. I think that is key. In driving this forward, right? So. Yeah, of course. And look at your. I would love to just take a quick run through the demo and just kind of see how the product works. Or maybe I can join it. And see, like, just how it works and, you know.  
Me: I mean, your insights here have been invaluable already to have. Again, your, your background and expertise in how you think about product and product in this space. Super helpful. This was again, like, I tried to really simplify everything for this deck, and now, you know, having a clear story on how we go deep and really what that first experiment is going to be, right? Because we have Jeffrey, a tech buffalo. He's all about this. They're, you know, considering an investment or at least dedicating some budget towards us building this. It aligns with 43 North foundation and the corporate connectivity pillars. So, you know, Jon Gavigan's talking about how do I get the top 10 leaders in Buffalo collaborating, right? And he, like, references the Vistage model. So I think we have a unique lever here today with where we sit on rolling this out and getting people like the top 250 involved. But as far as how you can help, I'D love to continue to share, you know.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: The depth of where I think this is headed and just kind of keep you involved on the product side, to be honest. You know, I want your insights and your nudges and all of this. Right. I appreciate the collaboration. If there's anybody I should meet, too, that are, like, really good people that you think this would resonate with, you know, those introductions are also very helpful.  
Them: Yeah, 100. I'm more than happy to do that. Absolutely. I'm more than happy to even get into some of the details, if you'd like. We could. Where we could brainstorm some of this. I'm also happy to, you know, go pitch this with you to, like, you know, UB or wherever, you know, whatever. Right? Or maybe even universities. Not just ub, but like, in the western New York area.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And. Yeah, I think there is definitely angles here that Will is. Is very good. If we can. If we can get that detail down. I think there's a lot here. And I really like what you said about going deep. You know, we live in a very superficial world. And so if we can go really deep and if we can quantify, at least say that Buffalo, you know, is a good growth community. And, you know, and, like, we can quantifiably have metrics that show that and we can get, like industry leaders and Buffalo area or western New York or even government folks or, like, talking about this. I think there's. There's a huge opportunity, right, to expand there. So I would go deep. I think Buffalo is great. I think our sister cities, you know, Rochester and, you know, Cleveland is probably better than Rochester, obviously, so I would kind of just start to, like, go through that. You know? Those communities. And the best thing is, we could partner with this stage. You could partner with eo, you could partner with, you know, tech stars in different, different, like, easily. If you get one city down.  
Me: I agree. I fully agree. Did Mike or Dan talk to you about getting access to the office so you could come hang out with us and jam on this type of stuff?  
Them: No. I then texted me earlier today. I responded to him and we haven't had a chance to connect. But yeah, I, I would. I would love to, man. Like, I, I, I am. You know, I've been cranking on Bright Room and just kind of like. And then I've just been kind of just trying to get this whole, that whole Salesforce thing. Thinking. I've been thinking about that. I have a lot of things in the fire, to be honest, Jonathan. And, like, so just kind of. Sometimes I'm a little, kind of isolated, I feel. And so coming to the office, I think would definitely be a good thing. So I'll. I'll. I'll talk to them.  
Me: Yeah, I hit him up. Like, we'll get you a badge. Like, and again, like us on a whiteboard for a little bit would be helpful. And again, just sharing ideas for across bright room, etc. Like, I think the energy we want to get going up here and you'd be awesome just to have in the room with us.  
Them: Yeah. Absolutely. That would be. That would be cool, man. So let me. Let me talk to Dan and. And then I'll. I'll touch base.  
Me: Awesome, Raj. Thank you so much, man. I certainly appreciate it. I'll keep you in the loop as this goes forward, but I hope to see you up on this floor soon.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm sorry about the delay in getting back to. Just been a lot going on, but I'm glad we were able to connect. And let's. We'll. We'll keep the conversation going, okay?  
Me: I love it. Thank you so much.  
Them: All right. Thank you. Thank you.  
Me: All right.  
Them: Bye. Bye.
