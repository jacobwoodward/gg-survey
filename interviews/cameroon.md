Date: Dec 4

Transcript:
 
Me: Hello.  
Them: Hello? Hello. Hi, jake.  
Me: How are you?  
Them: Doing? Well, how about yourself?  
Me: I'm also doing well. Thank you so much for responding to me and taking the time to chat with me for a few minutes today. LinkedIn sometimes feels like you're screaming into a black hole.  
Them: A black hole.  
Me: And I'm not going to beg, but I'm feed. And it was very kind of you to offer some of your time for me today.  
Them: Absolutely.  
Me: I sincerely appreciate it.  
Them: I echo that comment. I think for me this is how I kind of over time just rationalize it or made sense of my online presence. Is, nobody can tell your intent. But you. Right? So then, Therefore, the applauses after that, the recognition after that don't matter.  
Me: That's right.  
Them: You're not putting content out there because you're hoping to get a. Like you're sharing a part of you. And that it's okay whether or not you're recognized for it.  
Me: Yeah. It's interesting because I can see my own trajectory of how I use LinkedIn changing over time. Where at one point in my career where I would say I was a little, maybe a less mature, maybe a less evolved. It would be very performative, right? It would be like trying to get people to like me. Trying to get the likes, trying to get the engagement.  
Them: Right. Right? Right.  
Me: And now it's about being authentic and just being myself and saying the things I want to say.  
Them: Right. Because.  
Me: And.  
Them: Look, that's how the system had been set up, right? I don't know how many years of maybe corporate experience or just after university experience you've had. There's a system in place that measured sort of performances on that level. I quoted recently also about a kind of Naruto and task. Do you watch anime?  
Me: I don't watch anime. No, it's kind of in my wheelhouse. I'm a little bit of a nerd, so you'd think I would, but I don't.  
Them: I see. I see. Yeah. So I was just sharing that according to this anime called Naruto, there are two paths. Right. There's the academic path. Which is very structured, and it's kind of like being the top of your class. You get rewarded, the decision maker and things like that. It's fine. There's another path where there are people who have the knowledge and the experience. But it's more from just day to day, like practical things. One of the things I did in my AI journey is I went to about 13 countries. Just like, meeting human beings. I was just like, hey, you know, you see the statistics and you see the data, obviously, and these companies are saying all these things, but what's the reality on the ground? I'll tell you this, the reality on the ground is very different.  
Me: Yeah. Oh, I bet. Side topic. I need to know the 13 countries, or at least it has many of them, as you get rattled off. I'd love. I'd love to hear just a little bit of that.  
Them: So. I started in launched my company in 2024, beginning of 2024. Well created in 23 and then officially kicked off in 24. The first country I went to was the UK. I started in the uk. I have some family there, so use the opportunity to kind of stay there and then attend events. I went to AI events at the University of Birmingham, just, again, interacting with folks. The next place I went to was Germany. I went to Germany. I have an older brother who's there. My family's kind of scattered all over the world, so that's another thing. My perspective is blended from so many regions. So went to Germany after that, I went to Italy. I went to Spain. I went to Holland, I went to Switzerland. I attended the AI For Good Global Summit. Yes, in Switzerland. And so these places that you go to, this is the only thing I realize is I think there was a British royalty lady, I can't remember her name. Who was there? One of the attendees there. You could walk up to her. And have a chat and things like that. So I did that one this year.  
Me: Okay? I'm jealous.  
Them: I'm originally from Cameroon. I don't know if you know anything about African regions yet. So originally from Cameroon, based near us now. I've been here for about 15 years.  
Me: I don't know.  
Them: But kind of, I guess. I had never been to any other African country. Can you believe that? And Texas is three times the size of my country, so that's like being only in one city. And I had never traveled Africa. So this year,  
Me: Okay? All right. Okay?  
Them: I went to kigali. I went to zambia. And I went to kenya. Yeah. So I went to kenya. Yeah, I went to zambia.  
Me: That's awesome.  
Them: So it's amazing again, just being there. In Rwanda, they had the inaugural summit AI Summit on Africa.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: There.  
Me: Oh, wow, that's excellent. I'm interested just because I had not traveled the world much myself until somewhat recently, where I spent most of my time in the US and had won overseas trip to Amsterdam when I was like in my 20s. And other than that, I had never been to Europe or Africa or any other any other continent. And we went to Tanzania last year to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. And then next year, we wanted to go back to Kenya and do the Kenya side and maybe try. I'm gonna. Because we didn't. We didn't make it to the top, so we needed to go back and try again.  
Them: Wow. Yes. I see.  
Me: And maybe. And maybe do some guerrilla expedition, I think. Is that in Congo? But, yeah, so, like, you know, like, it's like, I'm definitely interested in all that stuff, but that's not. That's not why we're here to talk.  
Them: Go in the wildlife. Here. The world is. Yeah, the world is big. I'll tell you, There are all kinds of people, and each person is just living in their own bubble.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Each person has their you are a kind of result of your environment, of how you grew up. And all those things compound. Tell me a little more though, about your story. I want to hear. Jake, I saw your post and I think maybe there was a post before that or I know we connected recently.  
Me: Y. Eah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You know, my story in a nutshell is that I spent 25 years climbing the corporate ladder in the way that the American dream paints it out to be, right? So, like, you start small with an entry level job, and you get promoted and you get promoted and you get promoted, and next thing you know, you're at, like, the executive level. And for the most, the past 10 years.  
Them: Right. Right. Right.  
Me: I was a VP of product in software development. So I'm helping build software at three different health tech organizations, and the last company that I was I was with was struggling and ended up being acquired after I got let go. But, you know, I was let go about maybe a year and a half ago and I'M like, okay, this is no big deal. Like, whatever. I start applying.  
Them: Right.  
Me: And applying. And applying. And 1500 applications later.  
Them: Right? Right.  
Me: I still don't have a job. And I'm like, this is messed up, because, you know. And then I. But also I went deep into AI during that time. And. I taught myself by the code. Or my code, I should say. Right? And like, I. I was literally building applications myself in my home office that a year or prior would have taken me a team of 15 people and a few million dollars.  
Them: Right. Right. Right? Right. Right. Right.  
Me: And I could do it. I could do it myself in a few weeks.  
Them: AI is crazy. It's amazing. Yeah, yeah.  
Me: And, you know, I. I made a posting kind of one of those desperate pleas on LinkedIn about back in September. It got picked up by Business Insider. They did a profile on me. And that connected me with the people I work with now at a, at a venture studio, our radio ventures company that builds companies, essentially. And one of the ideas that we're working on now is essentially a. Platform that would kind of replace LinkedIn. Right. I think in its simplest definition, that's kind of what we're exploring.  
Them: Right. Right.  
Me: Because, you know, a lot of the people here were realizing that the world is changing. And then what. What worked for the past 20 years?  
Them: Right. Right.  
Me: Is not going to work in the future. And.  
Them: You want to listen to Green? Here.  
Me: I don't believe, and I don't think we believe that LinkedIn is going to evolve the way it needs to support the way that humans actually need to be connected, especially as AI and social media and things continue to disconnect us.  
Them: Right.  
Me: So there's a lot of people here that have, like, conversations that are outside the norm of, like, you know, typical business speak. It's like, no. How do we bring people together? How do we have, like, meaningful human relationship? Yeah, yeah.  
Them: Right. Humans. Humans, yes.  
Me: So, you know, we want to say, hey, how can we find two people that need a meaningful connection? And match them together in a meaningful way.  
Them: Right.  
Me: And that's why we're just trying to talk with as many different people as we can that use LinkedIn, that, that see the value in not just professional networking. But just networking with other humans and connecting with people who can help each other in a real sense of community that we're continuing to, like, lose in our society and find a way to do that in a way where it can be, you know, yes, a business, but at the same time, it's, it's. A business that's providing a value to society so that there's, like, this mutual agreement that, like, I think all relationships are mutually beneficial.  
Them: Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right.  
Me: Right. And I think this is the same type of. And this is a. How we're approaching it. We're approaching it with a good heart and not like, as like a money grind, I think, if that makes sense, right.  
Them: I agree. I do and should be. My. So there are a couple of questions or a couple of things I want to say as kind of follow ups. I see where you're at. You know, especially with the kind of internal conflict between, you know, monetization and, you know, it's not all about money and, you know, things like that. I could see that internal battle. It's good. You should. You should have it. That means. That means you're human. But the most valuable asset. That you have any of us has. Is time. How you spend your time is. Is kind of what you're looking to optimize. Do you have a math background? Do you? I mean, integrals and things like that.  
Me: Yeah. I mean, I'm pretty. Yeah, I would say so.  
Them: So. So there's an equation that I like to quote. I love to call that. It's the integral math, I think is such a. Such an artistic expression, I guess, in a way. You go the intro. What is at the bottom of that integral is when you're born. And then what's at the top? Is when you die. So that's life is just the passage of that moment when you're born, when you die. What you're trying to maximize. Hopefully. Hopefully is the amount of time you spend happy. So being happy means doing the things you love. Now. Is there? Should you be rewarded for doing the things that you love? Yes. It's just. It's how you spend your time. You could have dinner with Warren Buffett. He's just another human being. But it cost you an arm and a leg. And the reason is he has a perspective. Which you don't have. And it's valuable. And so when you provide that kind of value, it's okay to be rewarded. Right. It's okay, for the consequence of what you do is positive. It's net positive. More humans connected, more people finding opportunity. The world becomes a better place. It is quantifiable. So the internal conflict you have is good, right? Again, it shows that you really care about what you're doing.  
Me: Right. Yeah.  
Them: But now the final question I want to end with is, and the most fundamental one. For me. I have to answer that question as well. Before I started on my journey. Do you know who Simon Sinek is?  
Me: I do? Yes.  
Them: Okay? He has a book. Start with why. Have you read that book?  
Me: Start with Y. Have I? Have I? I I. I've read his book and I often listen to his podcast and any podcast if he's a guest on. I'm a big fan of his.  
Them: Indeed. He's very grounded. I love him because he's just a grounded person and gives a lot of perspective, right? So that's what I want to hear. What is your why? I'll tell you my why. I believe in those synergy between humans and technology. Right. A lot of the things that I know and I'm doing right now. It's not because it started today. O I am is not. You know, that's the only thing that always gives me comfort, is I'm not trying to be something I'm not. Already I've been this thing. Whether there's applause, whether there's recognition. But I believe in the synergy between humans and tech. I believe in it because it would lead to equity. The thing that LinkedIn does, which you're pointing out, is you're almost consolidating, you know, power. But. But now, what if, you know, each human is able to connect. To, you know, what they're passionate about, what they love to do, and somehow can make a living out of that. I think that's a net positive.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Right. So I just see technology, not just AI specifically. Now, AI is a good catalyst. AI is just a multiplier. But it starts with your why. So that's my why. I'm equity. I'm equity driven. The reason why I travel to all those countries is I went there to give perspective. I went there to say, hey, I know this is your reality, but let me tell you about this other reality. Like, these are the stuff that you can look up. That's happening all over the globe. You know, I went to Zambia thinking I was going to walk into a room of maybe five people, but there were, like, 30 students there. And it's literally as if I was speaking a foreign language because they couldn't understand. Not. Not that they couldn't understand, but, like, if you talk about something like Cryptocurrency. We in the US Are still struggling to like, like, what is this? Like, what is going on? So in that context, for them, it's like you're just so. But anyways, that's. That's my. Why. So I want to hear what's your. What's your motivator? What's. What's the thing that's, you know, getting you to take this leap?  
Me: Right. Yeah.  
Them: Jake.  
Me: My why is crystal clear to me now in a way that it wasn't even just a few months ago. And it's at the top of my LinkedIn profile. It is. I'm here on this planet to help transform the people the way people live and work. Full stop. Now, that will happen in a of various different ways, but that will always be my North Star. Because I've been through hell and back. And I feel like I have reached if my life is a three act play. I've just started my third act. And this is the. This is the part of my own story arc where I let go of my own ego. But I also embrace a reality where I know that I can help people and that I want to take my experiences. And everything that I've learned. And look at people that are struggling and lift them up and help them in a way that is impactful and meaningful. And if I can do that with one other human being that I, when I've accomplished something in my life that I can be proud of, right?  
Them: Yeah. Y. Eah.  
Me: And then at the same time, like, being a father is really important to me. I have six kids.  
Them: You have six kids? I just had my first.  
Me: I have six kids. Well, congratulations. You know, it changes. It changes your perspective on life and, you know, it's like, I want to prepare this and make this world a better place. I can't change it myself, but I want to be a part of it.  
Them: Thank you.  
Me: Part of what makes it better.  
Them: Right.  
Me: And that. That might sound like a lofty, unachievable goal, but there's this old country western song from when I was a kid that I remember from a singer named Garth Brooks.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Who has this song called the Change. And in it, he's. There's this one lyric that will always haunt me in the best possible way. He says, you know. I don't do that. I feel like the whole premise of the song is that he's trying to, like, you know, why are you doing this? It's not going to help anything. He's like, oh, I do this. So the world will know that it will not change me. Right.  
Them: Right.  
Me: So, like, I'm not. I'm not trying to change the world. I'm trying to do this, but the world doesn't change me.  
Them: Right. Right.  
Me: And I think that's. That's just the way that I try to live my life.  
Them: That's right. That's. That's very. That's very profound. That's very profound. So when I was. Let me tell you a little story. When I was 16, I was 16 or 15. Anyways. I was at a boarding school. And I was the youngest in my class, so the boarding school I went to is seven years. We stayed about, you know, well, three months, two. So we. Six months out of the year, we were gone. Staying on campus, you know, living and growing. So in my sixth year, I had the opportunity to run like we. We had a structure the same way we had a president. You know, we had a. You know, I was a dormitory captain. For the St. John's dormitory. So what that meant is I was taking care of about 80 students. Just making sure that they woke up on time, they were fed, they were clean. Conflict resolution. You know, making sure that everybody was good. So a lot of the things I tell people now, I'm like, This is what I've been doing. Right, but. I remember before, I was trying to run and I was talking to my mother. And I'm trying to strategize, and I'm trying to say, hey, I need to do this, and I need to convince people that, you know, hey, this would be a good path forward. We can build something. And I was, like, going on and on about my client, and she's just looking at, me. And then when I was done, She said. Is this going to change who you are? And I had never even considered that question. I was like, no. PE she was like, okay, then do it.  
Me: Right? Yeah, I love that.  
Them: So. Yeah, I think. I think that's profound, what you said about, you know, again, you're doing it for yourself, you're doing it for your kids, and you are. You know, it sounds to me like you're trying to make the world a better place, and it's not just, you know, there's. No amount of wealth that that kind of buys that. So I think the. The journey starts within, and then it just kind of propels up. I want to know now because, again, I'm very mindful of time. You notice this with me, you know, how are you spending your time? You go back to that. Equation.  
Me: All right? Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: I want to know what is the path forward right for you? At BC Advantage, we do three things. I do three things. I am a consultant. Being a consultant means that I solve problems, and I solve problems in all areas. It's another thing that you really surprises my clients. I've had somebody just reach out to me with a random request and say, hey, I'm trying to contact a guy. You know, in this country, I'M not really sure where to find or how to get in touch with them. I'm like, all right. So my job as a consultant is to apply my. My strategic hat. To solve a variety of problems, so that's. That's kind of how I spend my time. The other way I spend my time is coaching. Is coaching other people, you know, Again, what is that? Why? Adding strategy to it, adding implementation, keeping you accountable. Right? Because again, that's. That's simply what a coach is. Is someone who says, I'm not here to fight you. These are the things that you want to accomplish. And sometimes it helps just talking it out. With somebody else. Sometimes that helps. And then the third thing my business does is we build AI products and services. So on chat. Do you use chat GPT?  
Me: Exacerbate.  
Them: Yes. So. So you have been in the AI store, in the chat GPT store.  
Me: Yes y.  
Them: So I have an AI agent out there called vcai. I don't know if you tested it.  
Me: Eah. I had not. No, I'm not.  
Them: So. So I customize that agent myself. And the reason I did that. Is. Is kind of. Again, I have these questions come to me all the time, right? People always asking me things. So I just built a digital twin. It's very. A lot like me, where again, it. It lives in the moment, you know, if you ask chat GPT One of the essential differences is if you ask chat GPT. What were we talking about one year ago? Chat GPT has that long term memory. BCAI is not designed that way. I mean, you can always tweak the settings and things like that, but it's just, it's meant to answer your question, irrespective of who you are. I think sometimes in long term memory there's bias. Right. So it's just. Just like me. That's how I treat my consulting clients, my partnerships, you know, and things like that. So I think that's how the path forward for me, how I want to spend my time, it's in one of those things, building AI products, consulting or coaching. So now what? What is the long term for you? How are you planning to spend your time? Or how do you spend your time?  
Me: I think you know right now. Me personally is that I'm, you know, I'm. I'm on board with this venture studio as a consultant. Working full time. I'm validating this project idea that we're currently working on that could potentially grow to replace. Not replace LinkedIn, but what's like I said, right?  
Them: If. If I think here, when you said that the first time, here's something I thought is at the end of the day, if you can collaborate, because what you will do at the end of the day, you can compete. Sure, right? Or you can collaborate. Either path is not wrong. But what you are trying to add is the layer that is necessary, which is people should not be, you know, shouting, I guess in a void. Well, you can, but. But you're trying to connect humans, right? Which LinkedIn is. Is honestly not very. They're not doing a good job at currently.  
Me: Yes. Right. Right? Yeah. Not at all. Not at all. And I think that's really what we're. What we're trying to do. So it's a matter of right now, it's like, I'm not looking too far.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Down the path. As much as I am just trying to say right now, we have to validate this idea, talk to as many people as we can about what their pain points are with the platforms that exist. See what type of appetite they have for building stronger relationships to see if that's important to people like we have a pretty strong thesis that that is a problem that everyone would unanimously agree on. That like we are feeling more and more disconnected and losing our sense of community, both from a personal and professional point of view. So for us right now, and me specifically, it's going all in on this because about how passionate I am about it personally. And, you know, trying to build a solution that we think might, you know, be mutually beneficial to the people that use it and to the studio and. Grow it into something that makes a difference in the world.  
Them: Awesome.  
Me: How do you. How do you currently find customers? Like what? Like what. What. What mechanisms are you using? To connect with people that could use your services. Like what. What's your. What are your strategies? Are.  
Them: Right. So my mission, the company's mission. Bigger goal. Equity. But the way we achieve that. Is, you know, through purpose. Purpose? Alignment. You know, and A.I. so going to all these countries. Meeting people, right? Our growth has been very organic. From the beginning, very intentionally, you know, so. And I talk a lot about my work, the things that we do online. So there's a compounding effect that has been happening and building over time where it starts very organically. It starts with people seeing that, okay. Well, again, curiosity. What is. What is this about? What's this guy talking about? You know, to. Hey, I can relate to this, right? Because again, we all say AI and is. You know, there's. There's a thing called an AI bubble, right? I don't know if you heard that, so.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: It's kind of my job, or how I, you know, get people is talk about my personal experience, and I'd go, it's an AI. What is an AI Bubble was it like for me? So just putting my content out there over time has led to natural connections, right? Just. Just like this, which then become. Cause I guess we're all kind of complementing each other. So it's. It's like, where is the need? Right, so it's again, where's the need? What are we trying to do? That alignment with, you know, expertise and saying, okay, I think, you know, a lot of people can benefit from, you know, this experience. Or the people who've worked with me are just kind of referring other people. The other way is some of our initial clients have kind of become partners, right? Because our initial clients were coaching clients, you know, and so the path, the trajectory at the end of our coaching sessions are you kind of like, you go do your own thing, right? You find your why, you find your purpose. This is what you're motivated by and then you go kind of do your own thing and then still have partnership or you, you join BC Advantage. Because that is our way of solving this issue that you talked about, which is, you know, folks finding opportunities. Right. I, I collaborate with people who are also passionate about equity. Right. And, and bring them into my ecosystem. Because I think that's kind of where the future is going, is that, you know. You know, the bubble. We talk about each person living in their own bubble. In your own bubble, you're kind of the center.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: Of that bubble. Right? So you. You, over time, will just build ecosystems. You know, out of that. So I'm. I'm in multiple groups as well. School groups, you know, different groups. It's just been about having that honest conversation with people. Like, what do you need? It's a very hard question, you know, with AI this is the other thing I. I talk about a lot. Is. We have this engine, this powerful engine. But then the real problem is we don't know what to ask. We literally don't know what happens. It's like you could think you could solve in. There's a lot of getting people over to that point and then just going, no, look, you, the way you think and the way you've been seeing things has been very systematic because of the system. It's. Okay. But you have to think outside of the box. So that's just, you know, I. I will get people who either hear me speaking somewhere or saying something that resonates and then just kind of reach out. And then the relationship and ecosystem just kind of grows naturally from there. Our client base now, surprisingly, I was I was looking back, spent about four continents.  
Me: Right. Yeah.  
Them: At this point, just organically again. I don't know if you you keep a log but that's now advice for from me to you as a kind of founder is. Have you heard of a mind map?  
Me: Yes.  
Them: So. So if you keep a good lawn, I think over time, it will just kind of paint a good picture.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: Right of again who your clients are. You know what their needs are. Areas of needs and just it would. Just, like, the ecosystem would just kind of branch out from there. But that's how I get clients. What about you?  
Me: You know, for. For offer for me as a contractor. It's really just. It's just this one opportunity that I have right now, and I'm not really actively looking for anything else. Specifically. And I. I think that one thing that I know we're, we're at at. At time here, but I think there's probably one. One, one thing I wanted to say before we, we wrap up, and I think my next one is a five minutes late anyway, so I have a couple more minutes.  
Them: Yes. I could spare a few more minutes.  
Me: But I think the interesting thing about the opportunity here is to start connecting. People to help them find their people. Right? I, I, I I think that just because two humans exist in this world doesn't mean they're each other's people. And I think that finding those people that are going to be, like, the right matches for people to say that we have, like, aligned values and aligned beliefs, and that isn't to say that someone who isn't aligned with us is an enemy.  
Them: Correct. Yes.  
Me: Right, But I. But I think that finding our people.  
Them: Correct. Correct. That's the why. That's the why. Alignment. Yes.  
Me: Right, Right. It's like, I think that is an important aspect of all of this. And I think that as I've traversed my own reinvention, I guess, over the past couple years, and I've gone through, you know, a transformation of my. Of my own. It's really empowered me to want to find my people and to find the people that I align with. And that, you know, and I can just tell from this conversation that, like, you're my people, right? You're the kind of person that I want in my life. Right. Just to be blunt. Right. And it's just. It's. It's encouraging and rewarding.  
Them: Yes. Likewise. Likewise, yes.  
Me: To create those types of connections because prior to today, we didn't know each other and how we do. Right. And, you know, and if there's some way for us to work together in the future, Then that's. That's a possibility that didn't exist yesterday, so I.
