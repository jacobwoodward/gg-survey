Them: Yeah, I can hear you.  
Me: Yeah. I can hear you. All right, perfect. Well, first off, thank you so much for agreeing to chat with me for a few minutes. Getting people to talk to me has been very difficult, so I release sincerely appreciate this. I'll try not to hiccup too much of your time. I'll probably only need, like, 15. 20 minutes or so to get through my questions. And there's anything that you have for me, you can certainly ask them at the end.  
Them: Yeah, sure.  
Me: Jump the reading. I'd love to hear a little bit about you, at what point you're at in your, I guess, your career journey, if you started looking for internships or jobs. Or just give me a quick overview of where you're at in your career and we'll start there.  
Them: Yeah. Okay, I. Sure. So, currently I'm doing my Master's in computer science specializing in AIML at ub. Before that, I had a four years of experience in software development.  
Me: Okay? That shows. So currently. I'm doing my mast. Er's. In computer science. Specializing. In aiml. At u. B. Before. That I. Had a four years of. Experience in software development.  
Them: So before that, I was working at Wipro Technology.  
Me: So before that. I was working at Wipro Technology.  
Them: Have you heard about that?  
Me: Have you heard about that? Yes.  
Them: Company.  
Me: So. I was working there.  
Them: There for almost 2.5 years.  
Me: For almost 2.5 years.  
Them: And then I joined the startup, which is like Applied Bell Curve. The name of the company is that.  
Me: And then I joined. The startup, which. Is like app. Lying. Welcome. The name of the company. Is that and mostly over there.  
Them: And mostly over there since it was a startup, so I had to wear multiple hats. So basically I was in the front end, in the back end. And the main product was like. Main role was to develop a model which can predict the price.  
Me: Like I was since it was a startup, so. I had to. Wear multiple hats. So basically, I was in the front end, in the back end. And the main. Product was like. Main role was to. Develop a model. Which can predict. The price.  
Them: Of the commodities.  
Me: Of the. Commodities.  
Them: So that was the main responsibility. So, yeah, so that was done. And then I came to US for my master's in summer. I have done internship.  
Me: So that was. The main responsibility. So yeah. So that was done. And then. I came to us. For my masters. In. Summer. I have an. Internship.  
Them: But it was kind of an unpaid internship.  
Me: But. It was kind of. An unplayed internship.  
Them: And it was also a startup, which was like a small company, I think, like five to 10 members. And the name of the company was Velocity Road AI. So that was the company.  
Me: And it was also a. Startup, which was. Like a small. Company. I think. Like five. To 10 members. And. The name of the company was. Velocity. Road. Ex. So that was. A company. Okay?  
Them: That's all about me.  
Me: That's all about. Okay. That's a perfect way to level 70 here. So how far into your master is are you? Or when do you anticipate graduating? I guess what you my next question. Yeah. So. Yeah. So December coming. December.  
Them: Okay? Yeah. So December coming. December 15th. I will be graduating.  
Me: Fifteenth. I will be graduating, okay?  
Them: So this is an as semester going on.  
Me: Semester going on, okay? And then have you started, I guess, the process of looking for jobs? And I think that my question would be, like, how long have you been looking and what has that process looked like for you?  
Them: So, to be frank, like, it's very frustrating right now.  
Me: So, to be frank, like, it's very frustrating. Right now.  
Them: It's for international students specifically. I would say that because you have only a specific companies who can sponsor, who can do a sponsorship for you. Right. And they are kind of crazy. Rules are coming. Right. As you know that. Right. That's the big issue. So from the day I landed in US I'm trying to get. I'm trying to applications as many as I can. So almost like, I would say more than, like 5,000 applications.  
Me: It's. For international students. Specifically, I would say. That. Because. You have only a. Specific companies who can sponsor, who can do a sponsorship for you. Right? And they're kind of crazy. Rules are coming. Right now. As you know. That. That. 's the big issue, so. From the day. I. Landed in us. I am trying to. Get. I'm trying. Like I'm applying. To applications. As many as. I can. So almost like I would. Say. More. Than. Like 5,000. Applications.  
Them: More than that. So our daily, like, daily, almost daily. I'm applying for 30, 30 plus jobs every day. So it's, it's a lot of pressure for me. And the thing is, like, so I've also taken an education loan, right? So, so that is also something which is I have to take care. Because if I, if I go back to, like, I, I actually, I want to, like, get exposure in US and do, like, a job for, like, few years so that I can pay back my loan, right? And after that, like, and I can get exposure in US as well, and then maybe, like, I, I move back to India, so. That's the thing. The whole process is all, all about getting an education and then contributing to the society. Right? And then back to India. So that's, that's the motive. So that's.  
Me: Like. Daily 30 minutes. Almost daily. I'm applying for. 30. 30. Plus jobs. Every day. Okay? So it's a lot of pressure. For me. And the thing. Is. Like. So I've also. Taken an education loan. Right. So. So that is also something which is I have to take care. Because. If I. If I go back, actually, I want to, like, get an exposure. In us. And do. Like, a job for, like. Few years so that I can. Pay. Back my loan. Right. After. That. I can get the exposure. In us. As well. And then. Maybe like. I'll move back to India. So. That's the thing. The whole process. Is all all about. Getting. Education, and then. Contributing to the society. Right. And then. So. That's. That's the mot. Ive. So that's definitely a lot. A lot of applications. How many of those have turned into, I guess, Maybe not even turning to roll ups. How many people like have you actually spoken to that have gotten back to you? I would imagine if it's anything like what I've heard, I would imagine that response rate is pretty low. But what would you say it is?  
Them: Yeah, so, I mean, mostly, like, I only got interviews in the big tech one was Amazon.  
Me: Yeah. So I. Mean, mostly like. I. Only got interviews. In the big tech. One was Amazon.  
Them: For my internship, not for the full time. I got internship interview, but I unfortunately I couldn't convert that. So that was one interview during like in the 2024 May, I think.  
Me: For my intern. Ship, not for the. Full time. I got internship. Interview. But. I. Unfortunately, I. Couldn't convert that. So that. Was one interview during. 2024. May. I.  
Them: In that period. Right. Not in may, sorry. In december.  
Me: Not in case or in December.  
Them: So I came. I came in 2024, august.  
Me: So I came. I came in 2024, august.  
Them: And in December, period, I got the like interview call. And after that like I'm only getting a startup calls. But like what happens is first they will interact with you, they will get to know about more about you. And since they are startup or like a medium sized company, so they are not willing to, I mean pay that and they're not willing to sponsor. Right? So that's the thing. And the only thing is, and also is what, what is happening is suppose you give a first round, you get an interaction. Like you get in call with a recruiter. They get to know more about you, you share your profile, and after that, it's being ghosted. So like I, I, I always try to follow, send a follow up email. What about my process? They're not even declining or they are not even saying we have moved forward with the other candidate. Right. They are just ghosting. So that's a big problem.  
Me: And in December period. I got. Like interview call. And after that, like I'm only getting. A startup calls. But. Like what happens is. First. We will interact. With you they will get. To know about more about you. And since there are startup or. Medium sized company. So they are. Not willing to. I mean pay. That and they will not willing to sponsor. Right. So that's the thing. And. The only thing is. And also is what what is happening. Is supp. Ose you give a first? Round, you get an. Interaction like you. Get involved with the. Recruiter. They get to know more about you, you share your profile. And after that. It's being. Hosted. Like I. I. I always. Try to follow. Send a. Follow up email. What about my process? They're not even declining or they are not even saying. They are move forward. With the. Candidate. Right. They are just boosting. So that. 's a big. Problem.  
Them: What I have seen right now.  
Me: What? I have seen.  
Them: So, yeah, that's the thing. All about.  
Me: So yeah. That's. The theme all about? Yeah. And I know this probably won't make you feel any better, but it sounds like everybody that I'm speaking with is having the same type of experience, whether they're an international student or not. So for whatever it's worth. But I guess I'm wondering, you know, one of the things I kind of have heard is that more and more people have been trying to do networking and trying to, like, meet people and things like that. Like, what have you done when it comes to professional networking and trying to get out there and meet people and develop connections? What have you done in that space? And has that materialized any opportunities.  
Them: Okay? Yes.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So coming to that question, actually, in UB there is a specific portal, so where you can reach out to aluminize. Right. So I have been reaching out to many alumni in that portal. Right?  
Me: So coming to that question, actually, in Ub there is a specific port. Al so that you can. Reach out to alumni. Right. So I have. Been reaching out to. Many are really nice. In that port. Al. Right.  
Them: But the. As I said, like, the response rate is very low. I mean, I had reached out to one of, like, one of the friend, not the friend, like the alumni.  
Me: But. As I said, like. The response rate. Is very true. I mean, I had reached out to one of the, like, one of. The friends. Not the. Alumni and after.  
Them: And after like two days or three days, he sent me the. He sent me the message in LinkedIn, LinkedIn saying that, Hey, I have got one opportunity. Like, one of his friend is hiring.  
Me: Two. Days or three days. He sent me. The he sent me the message in LinkedIn saying that. Hey. I have got one hour. Like one of his friend is hiring.  
Them: So I just send him, okay, I'm interested. But till now, I didn't get any response back, so that's the thing.  
Me: So. I just send him? Okay, I'm interested. But till now. I didn't get any respons. E back. So that's. The thing. Yeah, that seems to be more and more the norm, unfortunately, you know, just. Switch gears a little bit like that. 's kind of the problem that we're trying to solve with the project that we're working on here.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: You know, I guess when it comes to LinkedIn, are you on LinkedIn? Do you. Do you use it much, if at all? Like how. How do you currently use LinkedIn if you're on there and use that? I guess is my question. Yeah. So to be honest,  
Them: Yeah. So, to be honest, like, more than an Instagram or a YouTube, I'm more. I'm more active on LinkedIn right now.  
Me: Like more than an Instagram or a YouTube. I'm more active on LinkedIn. Okay?  
Them: So I almost like 24 hours. If even I see any notification in LinkedIn I just scroll and see Hope if there is any person who is connecting with me.  
Me: Almost like 24 hours. If even I see any notification in LinkedIn. I just scroll and see. If. There is. Any person who's connecting. With me.  
Them: Or like, it's. It's crazy, but yeah, more. More active on LinkedIn as compared.  
Me: On the. It's. It's crazy. But yeah. I'm more activ. E on LinkedIn. Okay, okay. And do you feel like that being on that app has provided any meaningful value to anything that you've done? Or is it just like maybe. Maybe one day it will.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Okay?  
Them: So coming to that question, I would say yeah, it has. It has given me a lot of connection and a lot of networking in that like, like I'm able to meet and connect with same techie people's right in the, in the US.  
Me: So coming. To that question, I would say, yeah, it. Has. It has given me a lot of connection and a lot of networking in that. Like I'm able to meet and. Connect with same. Techy people's. Right. In the. In the us.  
Them: But the only thing is like the job portal, it's not very. It's not very good where you can apply for jobs because the recent jobs gets posted in LinkedIn after two to three days. So that's the problem with LinkedIn, but it is great for connecting with peoples.  
Me: But. The only thing is, like, The job portal. It's not. Very. Good where you can. Apply for jobs because the recent jobs gets posted. In LinkedIn after two to three days. So that's the problem. With clint. On, but it is great for connecting. With people.  
Them: So yeah.  
Me: Okay? When it comes to. I'm looking over, over at my question to make sure I'm covering everything.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: When it comes to looking for work opportunities. I guess besides length you mentioned LinkedIn. Maybe it might be a little bit delayed in terms of some of the posts that are there, but where? What other platforms are you looking for opportunities on?  
Them: Yeah. So before that, like, I was using LinkedIn rigorously because I was always looking for a new job posting in LinkedIn. But now, like more I'm directly referring to the company's portal. I'm going there.  
Me: So. Before that. Like I was using. LinkedIn. Rigorously. Because I was. Always looking for. A new job. Posting in LinkedIn. But now. Like more undirected to the company's portal. I'm going there and I'm checking for a new posting and like I'm directly applying for the product.  
Them: And I'm checking for a new new posting. And like, I'm directly applying from the company portal, not from the third party. Any other apps. Right? Yeah.  
Me: Not from the third party. Any other app. S right. Okay. And you feel like that approach allows you to be an early applicant. More often than not. Do you think you're seeing those posts? Are you going there frequently enough where you're seeing the new posts, the new job posts, like often.  
Them: Okay? No. So actually, what happens is, like, when you go to any company's portal, you can, like, subscribe to any new posting, right? You can? Yeah. You can, yeah. You can go there and try to type your email and tell me, like, if there is any new posting, send me an update in the email through email, right?  
Me: So actually, what happens is. Like when you go to any. Company's portal. You can. Subscribe to. Any new post name, right? You can. Go there and try. To type your email. And tell me. Like if there is any. New posting. Send. Me an update. In the. Email. Through email. Okay?  
Them: So I've subscribed to all these companies so I get. But it is also like very like you get an update. Suppose like time equal to zero, you got a post link, then it get reflected around one, two, I mean three to four hours.  
Me: Okay? Subscribe to. All these companies. So I. Get, but it is also like very like you get an update. Suppose. Like time equal to zero. You got posting. Then it gets. Reflected. Around. One. Two. I mean, three to four hours.  
Them: So that's the thing. It's not very latest, but yeah, you get like around 3 to 4 hours span.  
Me: So. That's the thing. In this. But yeah. You get? Like around three to four. Hours. Okay? Are you doing anything specific to try to stand out from the crowd? I guess. You know, obviously it's a. Sometimes it probably feels like you're just submitting resumes into a black hole, but are you custom tailoring resumes, looking for hiring managers? Like what. What strategies are you currently deploying to? I try to stand out.  
Them: Correct. So one thing I have done is first thing is I have built my own portfolio. So if you see my LinkedIn like, if so, I have already built my portfolio.  
Me: Correct. So. One thing. I have done. Is first thing. Is I built my own portfolio. So. If you see my link. Edin like this, so I. 've already built my portfolio.  
Them: Specific so they. Everyone can reach like they can see what, what works I have done. Like in the resume. You cannot like fit every projects or everything, right? So you can make a portfolio out of it and you can add all the projects you have done and what's the relevant experience you have, right?  
Me: Specific. So. Everyone can. Reach. Like they can see. What works. I. Have done. Like in. The resume. You cannot. Fit every. Project or everything. Right. So you can make. A portfolio. Effect, and you can add all. The projects you have. There and what the relev. Ant experience you have.  
Them: So that is one thing I have done. And apart from that, I think.  
Me: Right. So that is one thing I have done. And apart. From that. I think.  
Them: Apart from that. Yeah, I. When I. When I apply for any posting, right. Then I search for a hiring manager related to that posting and then I just cold email and I outreach to them.  
Me: Apart from that, Yeah. When I. When. I apply for? Any posting. Right. Then I search. For a hiring manager related to back posting. And then I. Just cold email and I outreach to them.  
Them: So. But yeah, I mean, still, I don't have any response, but I do cold email a lot to people's.  
Me: But. Yeah. I mean, still, I don't have any response. But I do. Cold email alone. To people. Okay, okay. I guess I'm just looking. There's my questions here.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: I'm going to switch over to the solution that we've been. Working on internally here that we're really having these interviews for this purpose is that we're seeing. Oh, actually, before I switch into that location, are you solely focused on in person local Buffalo opportunities? Are you looking for staying in Buffalo but working remote? Or would you travel anywhere in the US Once you graduate to, you know, like, what? What does that look like for you? Or is it like, any options on the table, given how hard the market is right now?  
Them: Okay? Yeah, I would. I would go with the third option. Anything. Like, I'm. I'm able. I can relocate, I can work from home. Anything. Any options? Uk? I can answer that, yeah.  
Me: Yeah. I would go with. That. Anything I'm able, I can relocate. I can work from home. Anything, any options he gave. I figured that would be the case. That's the answer that everyone has been giving.  
Them: Given that.  
Me: Again, if it's not like there's a lot of options and we can have our choice, it's kind of like we go where the job is, so that totally resonates.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: What we're looking at doing here is building a solution. I don't even want to call it an app, because it won't be an app. It's going to be the idea that we have right now that we're not. We haven't agreed to definitely build it, but we're talking to people, seeing that there's, you know, any legs to this idea. But the idea is that there would be a phone number that you would message, and then it would kind of an AI bot would work like a matchmaker, like a professional matchmaker to say, okay.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: We're going to learn about you. We're going to figure out what you're good at, what you're passionate about, what you believe. Get to know know you. Not just your resume. Right. We wouldn't want it to just upload your resume and that's your profile, because there's more to you than your resume, and we want to educate the system on that.  
Them: Yeah. Okay?  
Me: And then use that to match you with other people that might need you or that you might need them. So not even just jobs, but mentors or internships or coaches or whatever it may be. There's a bunch of different Personas that we're kind of talking to right now, and the idea is that we would be interfaceless. So it would all be done through existing messaging platforms that people are already using. So I guess with that question in mind, I'm wondering, what messaging apps are you currently using? Even if they're not, like, things that you're actively using, but, like, do you have WhatsApp on your phone? Telegram, like, the Discord? What are the messaging apps that you're using or would use? On a regular basis. Okay?  
Them: So coming to that question, I would say, like, I'm more frequent on WhatsApp as compared to other platforms.  
Me: So coming to that. Question, I would say I'm more frequent on. WhatsApp. As compared to other trans. Forms.  
Them: So, yeah, I mean.  
Me: So. Yeah.  
Them: So you. You mean, like, if you. If you want to. To make a call to someone, right?  
Me: So. You mean, like. If you. If you want to. Make a call to. Someone. Right.  
Them: So is that would be a, a phone call or a specific WhatsApp call? What do you what.  
Me: So. If that would be. A phone call. Or specific awards. Appointment. It would be. It would be mostly messaging, but I think we would connect people over messaging. We're like, both people would have to kind of turn the key, right? So, like, the. The assistant would say, hey, I have a student who is skilled in this thing, and he's looking for advice on what to do in this space. Right. And Jake, you have a bunch of information that I think would be helpful to him. Would you want to talk to him? And I might say, yeah, but I'm not. I'm busy this week, but I can talk to him next week, and then it will work to, like, put us together on a. Time that works for both of us, where we can talk.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Right? And there's a whole bunch of different reasons to connect people, but the idea is that it would build meaningful conversations with people and, like, penalize people for ghosting. Right. Like, it's okay to, like, say you don't want to talk to them, but, like, we don't want you to leave. Someone hanging right. There's a certain, like, that's become the norm in our society, and I think that's embarrassing for humanity, right? To be blunt. So we're trying to, like, fix some of that. Whether or not we can, who knows? But we're gonna. We're gonna, we're gonna. Take a swing at it, right? And I think we're all. All internally, we're very excited about it. So, you know, that's kind of why. Why I asked.  
Them: Okay? My answer would be like WhatsApp.  
Me: My answer would be like, What? Okay? And WhatsApp is actually the platform that we're looking at using. It seems like most people either have it and use it regularly, or at least have it installed on their phones, even if they're not using it regularly. So it seems like that's probably our best, our best bet to start off and then. Let me see. I think I had one more question on my list here that I didn't get to.  
Them: Please. Correct. Yeah. Okay?  
Me: No, actually, I covered everything I needed to.  
Them: That's the thing which I wanted to point out. Like over here, there's not a lot of networking happens. So that's the thing which is missing, maybe.  
Me: That's the thing which I wanted to point out. Like over here. There's not a lot of networking happens. So that's the thing which is missing, maybe. It's odd because they're historically used to be a bunch of things locally. There was Buffalo Startup Week and Buffalo Startup Weekend and there was like the Buffalo Open Coffee Club and just different things that used to be pretty significant events that they've all just kind of dwindled away.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: And people are becoming less connected locally. And I feel like our community, our tech community, is really suffering from that lack of connection with people. And I think that 43 north as being an organization that's involved with Radialventures. Obviously, there's a pretty big desire to kind of fix some of that. Which is kind of another reason that we're trying to focus on this problem. Is we think there's multiple angles for us to improve things. For people, right?  
Them: Correct. Yeah. Thank you so much. Yeah. That's all I have. Thank you so much.  
Me: Thank you so much. That's all I have. Awesome. Well, thank you so much. It was great to meet you. Sincerely, from my heart, bottom of my heart, I really appreciate taking time to talk to me. And it's also always good to make a new connection. So face to face, human to human, connection is always better. Than the ghosting digital stuff. So it was nice to meet you. And if you ever need anything, feel free to reach out.  
Them: Yeah. Thank you so much. I'll definitely reach out. It was my pleasure to have a conversation with you. Thank you so much.  
Me: Yeah. Thank you so much. It was my pleasure. To have. A conversation with you. Thank you so much. All right, thanks. All right, take care. Bye.
