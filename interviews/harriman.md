Me: Yeah. No, of course. Just so you know, I found you through the Executive Career upgrade Slack, which were both a member of or were a member of. So I had done that program at one point. And so I kind of think that you might be in at least a place where some of what I said in my email might resonate. And I'D love to kind of hear your take on a few things, if you don't mind me asking a few questions.  
Them: Yeah. Yep. Not at all.  
Me: Yeah. Maybe if we could just start by just giving me kind of like a brief overview of you, where you're at in your career, where you're headed, and then I could kind of use that as a springboard for my questions. Sure. Yeah. So the cliff notes on me.

Them: Back in the day. I remember it so when. When you hit me up.  
Me: Back. In the day. I remember. It. So when you hit me up.

Them: In this world, in the corporate level and leadership level, to do things better.  
Me: In this world. In a corporate level. And leadership level to do things better.  
Them: It's easy to put, you know.  
Me: It's easy to put.  
Them: Words on a wall.  
Me: Words on a wall.  
Them: And missions and values and things like that. But it comes down to, you know, what's the verb, look like, the action? And are you are you walking the talk? And that always speaks heavily to me. And so when I read read your piece, your article, it stuck out, it hit a chord, and it's something I'VE always just kept top of mind. It's something I'm passionate about. I think in anything that we do in life,  
Me: Missions and values and things. Like that. But it comes down. To. What's the verb look like? The action. And are you walking the. Talk. And. That always speaks heavily to me. And so when I read. Your piece, your. Article. It stuck. Out. It. Hit a chord. And. It's something I've always. Just kept top of mind. It's something I'm passionate about. I think in anything that we do in life.  
Them: It should help humanity.  
Me: It should help humanity.  
Them: Build up humanity and. And not extract from it. And I think we're. We're kind of regressing in a lot of ways from what we've been seeing.  
Me: Build up humanity. And not extract from it. And I think. We're kind of regressing in a lot of ways. From what we've been seeing.  
Them: Against the means. So anyways, a little, little bit long winded, but that's kind of where I'm at today. And right now I'm an assistant GM for a company for manufacturing, distribution company where I have my hands on a lot of things.  
Me: I guess to me. So anyways. A little bit long winded, but that's kind of. Where I'm at today. And right now I'm an assistant GM for a company. For manufacturing distribution company. Where I have my hands on a lot of things.  
Them: Including sales still, so.  
Me: Including sales still. Okay. All right. Well, first off, thank you for that. I'm glad to hear that my story resonated with you. And I think that where I find myself now is any unique position because I ended up joining a venture studio and I'm working with them. They're basically a company that starts companies, and one of the things that they're working on now is in this exact space that I'm so passionate about. Right. So they're looking at pretty much everything that's broken with professional networking in general. Right. The way that we pretty much only have LinkedIn as like our single platform to use for professional networking. And it's very performative. And it becomes this norm for everyone to just ghost everybody. And just the humanities seem to be just, like, draining away. And I'm sure Covid has kind of played a role in kind of the loss of connectivity. AI has played our role in that social media. In general, put a role in that. So I think we're working on this project to talk to people, get out here, just be like, what problems are you seeing? What problems have you been facing? So I'm going to use that as kind of like my basis for a few questions I have for you. But I'm just wondering, especially with your background in sales, right? Networking and meeting people and making those connections is obviously a big part of what you do, so I'd love to hear just maybe what your some general thoughts on how you network today. If you're actively trying to seek new connection and look for leads like how are you making doing networking today? What does that look like for you?  
Them: So. Yeah, good question. So, as far as actively outside of work, trying to make connections,  
Me: Yeah. Good question. So as far as. Actively outside of work. Trying to make connection. S.  
Them: Flat out. No, just. There's only so many hours in the day, so if it's not work, it's devoted to family right now.  
Me: Flat. Out. No. There's only so many hours in the day. So if it's not work, it's devoted to family right now.  
Them: And it just. It is what it is. It's priorities. Right. So. But connection is very important to me.  
Me: And it is what it is. It's prior. Ities. Right. But. Connection is very important to me.  
Them: Fortunately, I get that right now through my current position. It's a field based position when we're out there selling in front of the customer. But making connections can be tough.  
Me: Fortunately, I get that right now. Through my current position. It's a field based position. When we're out there selling in front of the customer. But making connections can be tough.  
Them: You know, my. My thought behind it is, what value am I bringing to the exchange? Right? Coming in, you can tell somebody that's looking just to kind of check a box and see if they can get from you versus somebody who's genuine. Maybe did a little bit of research, you know, already brought a little value. Up front.  
Me: My. Thought behind it. Is what? Value am I bringing to the. Exchange. Right. Coming in. You can tell somebody that's looking just to kind of check a box and see if they can get from you versus somebody who's genuine. Maybe did a little bit of research. Already. Bargon buy you up front.  
Them: So those things are important to me.  
Me: So. Those things are important to me.  
Them: I. I could pretty much tell right out of the gate who's genuine, who isn't.  
Me: I pretty much tell right out of the gate. Who's genuine. Who isn't.  
Them: When it comes to making connections. You mentioned LinkedIn.  
Me: When. It comes to making connections. You mentioned LinkedIn.  
Them: Of course. That is transition and evolved over time.  
Me: Of course. That is transition and evolved over time.  
Them: I kind of make a running joke. It's basically. I think it's become Facebook with a. With a clip on.  
Me: I kind of make a running joke. It's basically, I think it's become Facebook with a clip. On.  
Them: So clip on tie so.  
Me: So coupon time. Accurate.  
Them: But. But that being said, you know.  
Me: But that. Being said.  
Them: It's garbage in, garbage out. So I try and fill my feed with things that are going to be value added.  
Me: It's garbage in, garbage out. So I try and fill my. Feed with things that are going to be value added.  
Them: And. And the algorithm is going to pick that up, right?  
Me: And the algorithm is going to pick. That up. Right.  
Them: So I tell that to a lot of people. I'm like, yeah, there's a lot of distractions out there on social media. I don't think it does us any favors from a connection standpoint. But if you really get disciplined and refined, your approach about what you're paying attention to, the algorithm. Will pick up on that. And, you know, you'll start seeing more things and people that resonate and align with you, because you probably heard the thing.  
Me: So I tell that to a lot of people. I'm like, yeah. There's a lot of distraction out there with social media. I don't think it. Does us any favors. For the connection standpoint. But if you really get disciplined and refine. Your approach. About what you're paying attention to, the algorithm will pick up. On that. And you'll start seeing more things and people that resonate and align with you, because you probably heard the thing.  
Them: You know, you're basically the five people you surround yourself with.  
Me: The five people you surround yourself with.  
Them: Well, you know, social media is, is a resource, right. And so for me, it's important to surround myself when I do go out there on those platforms with value added content and people.  
Me: Well. Social media is a resource, Right. And so for me, it's important to surround myself when I do go out there on those platform. S. With value. Added content and. People.  
Them: So sometimes easier said than done because everybody's got access to you just like you have access to everybody else. Right? But anyways, there. I'm always big on the value exchange. What value am I bringing into the conversation? What value am I getting back? I'm. And I can count on one hand the friends. I have. Because if you're not adding value to me and we're not growing together, or I'm not adding value to you,  
Me: Though sometimes easier said than done. Because. Everybody's got access to you just like you have access to everybody else. Right. But anyways, I'm always big on the bayou exchange. What? Value am I bringing into conversation? What buy you am I getting back? And. I can count on one hand the friends. I have? Because if you're not. Adding value to me, and we're not growing. Together, or I'm. Not anybody to you.  
Them: That's all right. Just we're probably not going to be best buds, right? So I don't really do the work life balance thing. It's a life balance thing, so. And it keeps me squared away and it keeps things simple for me.  
Me: That's. All right. Just we're probably not going to be best buds, right? So. I don't really do the work life balance thing. It's a life balance. Thing. And it keeps me squared away and it keeps things simple for me. Yeah, I'd like to go back to the before you got the opportunity that you're now, did you go directly from the last job to this job now, or did you have a break in that? Like, what did that search look like for you? How was that? Yeah.  
Them: Yeah. No, I had a. I had a break.  
Me: No. I had a break.  
Them: Partially by design, intentionally. I didn't realize how long it would take, you know, going back to. To your experience. I experienced some of the same things, so I was ready to get back after it a little sooner than it actually took. And I kind of had an under appreciation for what that looked like when I stepped off. But basically, I've always operated. Again, like I said, alignment.  
Me: Part. Ially by design. Intentionally. I didn't realize how long it would take. Going back to your experience. I experienced some of the same things. So. I was ready to get back after. It a little sooner than it actually took. And I kind of. Had an underappreciation for what that looked like. When I stepped off, but basically, I've always operated again. Like I said, alignment.  
Them: You know what's in tune with me?  
Me: What's in tune with me.  
Them: Where am I making an impact? Am I at service to others? And I've always kind of had the mindset that I owe it to that organization. If I feel like I'm not both feet in that, they need to go find somebody that can be or wants to be. Right. And so, you know, I was fortunate at the time to be able to step up, spend more time with my family, help my wife be more present with the kiddo. And then that was almost about a year and a half.  
Me: Where am I making. An impact. Am I a service to others. And I've always kind of had the mindset that I owe. It to that organization if I feel like I'm not. Both feet in that. They need to go find somebody that can be. Or wants to be. Right. And so. I was fortunate at the time to be able to step off, spend more time with my family, help my wife be more present with the kid. Do. And then. That was almost about a year. And a half.  
Them: Before I actually was able to get back to work, but again.  
Me: Before. I actually was able to. Get back to work. But. Again.  
Them: I also look for the opportunities and everything. So for me, it was a good reset on what am I really looking for. I decided, you know, inside sales is not where I need to be. Not right or wrong, just not a good fit. Doesn't fill me up like other things do. And so I really was intentional about what I was looking for going forward. And I, you know, I sympathize with the people who are applying all over the place. I didn't take that strategy necessarily. And maybe that's why it also drug out for me too, is I was very tactful.  
Me: I also look for the opportunities. And everything. So for me, it was a good reset on what am I really looking for? I decided inside sales is not where I need to be. Not right or wrong, just not a good fit. Doesn't fill me up. Like other things do. And so. About what I was looking for going forward and. I sympathize with the people who are applying all over the place. I didn't take that strategy necessarily. And maybe that's why it also drug out for me too. Is. Very. Tactful.  
Them: With. With where I was reaching out. And part of that was through having those engaging connections.  
Me: With where? I was reaching out. And part of that. Was through having those. Engaging connections.  
Them: And reaching out personally to people and trying to. To bring value to them in that conversation. And it took time, but.  
Me: And reaching out personally to people and trying to bring value to them in that conversation. And it took time. But.  
Them: It was hard nonetheless.  
Me: It was hard nonetheless. Yeah. So the opportunity that you ended up at now, did that happen because of just the connections that you had made and the reaching out, or was that just like a blind application that turned into an interview and turned into a job? What was the process that you took to get that current opportunity?  
Them: Yeah, I just. I got outreached by, like, a consulting recruiting firm that was representing the company, and it kind of went from there.  
Me: Yeah. I reached by consulting recruiting firm that was representing the company. And kind of went from there. Got you.  
Them: So yeah, that wasn't necessarily a connection of what I was doing. I had never met known about the company or I'm at the individual I went through before. So kind of like fell into that one, I guess by happenstance.  
Me: So yeah. That wasn't necessarily. A connection of what I was doing. I had never met. Known about the company. I'm at the individual I went through before. But. Going to that one, I guess. By happenstance.  
Them: But. But I've still, you know, I've made some really good connections. So for whatever reason, this company, you know, you know, layoffs. The only thing I know is, like, today, you can be one of the top performers and still lose your job. You know, the times of showing up, working hard, adding value to the company, you know. You know, keeping your word, things like that, trustworthy. You still want to bring those things forward. But there's just so much we don't control anymore. And I. I truly believe the professional and social contract between employee and employer has just been broken.  
Me: But. I. Made some really good connections. So. For every reason. This company. Layoff. S the only thing I noticed. Today. You could be one of the. Top performers. In. Still lose your job? The times of showing up, working hard, adding. Value to the. Company. Keeping your word, things like that. Trustworthy. You still want to bring those things forward? But there's just so much we don't control anymore. And I truly believe the professional and social contract between employee. And employer has just been broken.  
Them: And.  
Me: Yeah. I would imagine that even coming from the military and having it of the appreciation for loyalty, it's like there's no loyalty anymore in corporate America. But maybe one time at a time. There used to be, at least, even if it was lightweight. Today it seems like that's totally gone. Wouldn't you. Say no. Yeah, I would agree with that. I mean, you just see it and just. It used to be it was the last resort to have to lay somebody off, and now it's part.  
Them: No, Yeah, I would agree with that. I mean, you just see it and just, you know, lay. You know, it used to be you would. It was the last resort to have to lay somebody off, and now it's part of a business plan.  
Me: Of the business.  
Them: You know, if it helps the bottom line and pumps up the stock price, so to speak, we're looking at, and unfortunately, like, raising, like, prices. When you see something, the buyer gets used to that new price and it never comes back down. Well, we have gotten used to layoffs just being a part of the drill, right? And so it's just baked into the, the culture now professionally. And it's sad to see, because if, if, you know, it's. It's a shame. I tell my wife I'm frustrated. I haven't come up with anything on my own because, you know, I operate on principles. And one of the last things I would ever want to do is look somebody in the face and say, I have to let you go. Because, you know, we're not. We're not doing what we were hoping we were doing. You know, I look at it like surgery. It should be a last resort.  
Me: Plan. If it helps the bottom line and pumps up the stock price, so to speak. We look at and unfortunately like raising prices. When you see something. The buyer gets used to that new price and it never comes back down. Or. We. Have gotten used to layoffs just being a part of the drill, right? And so it's just baked into. The culture now professionally, and it's sad to see because it's a shame. I tell my wife I'm frustrated. I haven't come up with anything on my own. Because. I operate on principles. And one of. The last things I would ever want. To do is look somebody. In the face. And say I have to let you go. Because. We're not doing what? We were hoping we were. Doing? I look at elect surgery should be a last resort.  
Them: Not an upfront option.  
Me: Not an upfront. Option. Exactly. I love that. And I'm trying to think of what I also have on my list of questions for you. I think I'm wondering what are the things that we're playing around with? Is this idea that when you are looking for connections, Wouldn't it be great if there was some. Professional matchmaker that you could talk to and just say, hey, I'm looking for someone that meets at this criteria. And then basically do, like, an introduction almost think about a matchmaker in the dating world. But a matchmaker in the professional world, Right? And both people would have to turn the keys to talk. Right? But then those introductions can be made in more meaningful ways.  
Them: Right.  
Me: And the idea is that maybe it wouldn't be yet another app you have to have to download, but is using existing chat tools like you already use, like whether it's done via SMS or iMessage or WhatsApp or things like that. So I'm wondering from an app perspective,  
Them: Right.  
Me: What messaging apps are you consistently active on? Do you use WhatsApp? Do you use just SMS? Are there any other chat tools that you're using on a regular basis?  
Them: Yeah, I mean, primarily SMS text outside, you know, whether within or without work. WhatsApp, from time to time. There's a little bit of signal in there, but very little of that.  
Me: Yeah. Primarily SMS text outside whether it's in or without work. WhatsApp from time to time. There's a little bit of signal in there. But. Very little of that.  
Them: Yeah, unfortunately, I. I hate to not be able to give you any better answers. I just. It, you know, works long. The days are long. Right. And then it's. It's. It's family focused after that because I just. I prioritize presence. Like when I'm at work, I'm at work. And then home. I'm home.  
Me: Yeah, unfortunately. I hate to not be able to give you. Any better answers. That's okay. It works long. The days are long, right? And then. It's. Family focused. After that because I prioritize presence. Like when I'm at work. I'm at work. And. I'm home.  
Them: And it doesn't leave a lot of time for a lot else. But that's okay, because I'm fortunate. I got a great family, and that's where I want to be, too. And I want to dive into that so it works itself out. But I like the idea of, like, the matchmaking, like. Especially from, like, you know, as somebody who's looking to level up, you know, like a. Call it a mentor or whatever, or just.  
Me: And been out of time. For a lot else, but that's okay. Because I'm fortunate. I got a great family, and that's where I want to be, too. And I want to dive. Into that. So. It works itself. Out. But. I like the idea. Of the matchmaking. Especially from. If somebody was looking to level up. Call it a mentor or whatever. Or just.  
Them: A camaraderie of being able to bounce things off people because to your point,  
Me: A cam. Araderie of being able to. Bounce things off. People because to your. Point.  
Them: You know, just with the way we see the professional workplace today, it's hard to be able to know who you can trust or have those outlets within the organization. So be able to go outside of that.  
Me: Just with the way. We see the professional. Workplace today. It's hard to be able to know. Who you can trust or have those outlets within the organization. So be able to go outside of that and.  
Them: And feel feel comfortable having kind of like a third party, independent, non biased person that you can share some of the things you're seeing and experiencing I think would be truly valuable, especially today.  
Me: Feel comfortable having kind of like a third party, independent, non biased person that you can share some of the things you're seeing and experiencing. I think would be truly valuable, especially today. Yeah, I love that. Okay, great. I promise you I'd keep this brief. I know we're 15 minutes here, so I definitely have enough from you. I really appreciate taking the time to talk to me. Like I said, it's been hard to find people that connect with, so I sincerely appreciate it. Human to human. Right. Thank you so much. We're made to connect, so it's one of the reasons I think we're seeing some of the frame that we're seeing is lack connection that's out there. So kudos to you for one to dig into that.  
Them: All good. Oh, yeah. I appreciate that. We're made to connect. So it's, it's one of the reasons I think we're seeing some of the frame that we're seeing is the lack connection that's out there. So kudos to you for, for wanting to dig into that and, and, and, and. Bring some. Bring some value forward on that front.  
Me: And bring some value forward on that front. Awesome. I appreciate that. You might hear back from me at some point, connect with you on LinkedIn if I can find you and treat me as a new connection so we can go from there. Absolutely. Okay. Appreciate that. Nice to meet you.  
Them: I respect. Sure. Absolutely. Appreciate that. Jake. Likewise. Have a good holidays.  
Me: Likewise. All right, take care.
