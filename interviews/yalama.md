Me: Hello? Can you hear me okay?  
Them: Yeah. Can you hear me?  
Me: Yes, I can. Perfect. Awesome. Well, thanks so much for hopping on the call. I really appreciate it. I'm excited to talk to you today.  
Them: Thank you so much. How are you doing?  
Me: Doing pretty well. Doing pretty well. I'm wondering how you found me. I guess is my first thing. Because you asked if you could talk and you had some questions. And I had also just recently posted on LinkedIn about wanting to speak with students who were entering the workforce. So I'm wondering, did you see my post? Or was it just coincidence that.  
Them: Yeah, I think it was a coincidence where the first time I saw your post, I think it wasn't exactly about students or anything, but you were like, let's connect. And I was trying to talk to a lot of people because right now I am searching for a job. And I wanted to talk to a lot of people and figure out what industry is actually expecting. And are they hiring freshers? I'm fresh out of college right now. I finished my master's from Purdue. And I'm still looking for a job. It's been, like, five months. So I'm trying to talk to people. And then I saw your post after that, after I texted you about it, I saw that you're actually willing to talk to a lot of students.  
Me: Cher.  
Them: So, yeah, perfect.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Perfect. I think rather than pepper you with my questions first, I want to try to be as helpful as I can for you. If you checked out my LinkedIn profile, you know that I've been in the software space for, like, 25 years or so. And I've been so heavily involved in all the different aspects of software development.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And have been spent most of the past like decade at the executive layer at a bunch of different health tech startups. But for me. I've also firsthand had to see. How the job market has changed a lot over the past few years. I think there's a lot of different factors at play, including AI but not exclusively that. I think everyone loves to blame AI I don't think it's had that big of a drastic impact. I think that we're actually going through a recession, but nobody wants to call it that yet. So I think there's just a whole bunch of different factors all kind of at play all at the same time, which are making it difficult. And I myself was out of work for about a year and a half until just recently.  
Them: Right.  
Me: So I also experienced that pain firsthand. So it's like a lot of different aspects that I have. And I'd be happy to answer any questions that you had before I dive into my own.  
Them: Yeah, I understand. So I'll just give you, like, a small intro about myself. Harshit. I'm from india. So I moved here for my master's degree in computer science before this. I graduated and worked. I graduated in my undergrad and worked for, like, six months. That was it. That was my whole work experience. And then I moved here. And I worked at this company called Everest for a little bit as an intern. But basically that's all my experience right now, and I'm a lot into data engineering. That's what I've been exploring, and I was working as well. I was really good at SQL and stuff like that. I've learned aws, Cloud, Snowflake and Facebook. So I built a couple projects, too, and I have a website hosted and everything. And even after all this, I've been trying to apply, like, perfect my resume for every single job application. I'm trying to tailor my resume. Still, I've got, like, zero responses in total. Not a single positive response. So what am I doing wrong?  
Me: Yeah. I wish I had the answers for you there, because I don't know if this is good or bad, but I keep hearing very similar stories over and over again from a lot of different people. Right. So I think that maybe there's some comfort in knowing that it's not you, but the system that we find ourselves in right now. The entire process that we use to match talent with open opportunities is, I think, actively breaking before our eyes. Right. Because what happens is you have all these people that are hosting jobs that might need to fill a position, and they're using AI to screen the applicants. But then the job applicants are also using AI to custom tailor their resumes for the job posting. And so it's just this standoff where no one's getting connected. And it seems that a lot of the opportunities that do materialize for people. They are far and few between, but they are all happening because of connections that people have or introductions from people or I know this person's hiring and I know this person's looking. And they might be a good fit. But that only works when there are meaningful relationships that exist. And it's not as simple as, oh, I connected with this person on LinkedIn six months ago, and I've seen a few other posts, because a lot of the posts on LinkedIn end up being performative, right? It's this facade that we put up. They're not very authentic, so. It's difficult for me because I want to sit here and say, here's what I think you should do. Here's how I think you'd be best positioned to find that job. And I definitely don't have all the answers. Other than maybe a couple recommendations, I think that having a showcase of the things that you've done. Are going to be way more valuable than any resume.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: You still need the resume. Don't get me wrong, right?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: It's part of doing business. But I think that one of the things that is going to be important is to continue playing. I know. I saw your GitHub. I saw you have that project up there with the lyric analysis and things like that. So I think that. I think a good use of your time. In between spending all your time looking for work, but also to build some projects that could demonstrate how you think through problems. And not just like, here's the end result, here's the thing I built, and here's how it works, but here's the problem I solved, and here's the critical thinking skills I used to think through why I would solve the problem this way.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: And I think that will do two things. The first thing is it will showcase more of the value that you're going to bring to an employer. In a way that is easier for them to consume than trying to figure that out by look at your resume. Because all resumes look the same for the most part, right?  
Them: Okay?  
Me: I mean, if you're applying for a job that is specific for a data engineer or something specific that's in your wheelhouse, Every other of the thousand applicants are going to have resumes that are going to look pretty similar to yours. Right. So having a showcase of how you think through problems is going to be an interesting one to do that. And if there's a job that you really want and you think is, like, a really good fit for you, Go after it. In a unique point of view. Like find the address of the person and send a box of donuts and with a QR code on the inside to your portfolio. That sounds silly. But it's the kind of thing that makes you stand out, right? And also having that portfolio also demonstrates that you're not just like everybody else. Right. And that there's something about you that's different if you just try to be another lemming in the crowd of lemmings. It's very difficult, especially in the economy that we find ourselves in and with the way things are changing. And I think that this has also changed over the past few years because of the rapid acceleration of technology developing with AI and stuff like that. But for the past 25 years, to spend this slow, steady march upward where things are getting easier and better and whatever, but now things are changing so quick that most of the jobs that exist in tech right now. Are going to be completely different in five years. I've spent most of my career with this very clear delineation of what a product manager does, what a project manager does, what a software engineer does, what a data engineer does, and how they're all different. They all have their roles and they all do their part of the development. In five years, they're all going to be blended together.  
Them: The lines are there.  
Me: You've been learning based off of what was and not being prepared for what will be again, I'm sure. I'm not familiar with the curriculum at Purdue, but I'm sure it's one of the best, so I'm sure they did some preparation for that, but at the end of the day, Nobody knows. It's like we are trying to predict the future. And having those critical thinking skills and being able to showcase that you're willing and able and you've demonstrated the ability to think for yourself. And navigate those different things. That's the best advice I can give you. So hopefully that's helpful. Are there any other questions we have on that before I kind of ask my own questions?  
Them: I had just, like, one more question. How would you suggest to network with other people like this? Cold outreach isn't working. I've sent out a lot of Coldiums. But nobody's responding.  
Me: Yeah. Do you have a specific market? Are you looking to stay in your local vicinity, or are you willing to go anywhere?  
Them: Yeah, anywhere in the U.S. honestly, I wouldn't mind moving at all.  
Me: I think that's all. I think I would strongly recommend face to face types of networking. I think that digital networking is so difficult because it is just performative and shallow for the most part.  
Them: All.  
Me: Ironically, the project that I'm working on, that I'm trying to get people to talk about, is the idea of bringing people together in their local communities. So for me, I'm based in western New York in Buffalo. And we have a really strong community here. And we want to match people and bring people in our community. As opposed to this global aspect of everybody just gets spread so thin. Right. I think that we want to bring people together in our communities, and I think that wherever it is that you might think you might want to focus on. It's a lot to say, like, oh, yeah, go move to some job market where there's going to move to Austin or something and focus on Austin and just go to every networking event you can and talk about the projects you've worked on and talk about the things that excite you.  
Them: Right.  
Me: But also I think that those are the types of things that are going to be the most effective.  
Them: Actually. Right? Hopefully. Because I've seen that all the core dms, everything online is just performative. Nobody even responds. Every single DM is literally the same.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Even the poster in LinkedIn are just performative. I just open and keep scrolling through and it looks like AI wrote them. Nothing else. There's no real content, but it's just motivation. There's nothing what you're supposed to do. It's just do it.  
Me: And again, this is my personal advice. I would dial into authenticity as much as possible. Try to don't let AI write your posts for you. Just speak from your heart and be yourself. And I think that is the type of thing that is going to make people stand out from other people, because I feel like people are going to get trapped in that cycle. Of being performative and relying on AI that things for them and they're right for them.  
Them: Again.  
Me: And they're going to become so much more used to that. That being your authentic, true self, it sounds like. Oh, of course, but. It's so valuable, and I would encourage that. Yeah. So I guess. How long have you been looking for work? How long have you been out there trying to find work for?  
Them: Probably. It's been over eight months, I would say, because I graduated five months ago and started way before that. And before that, Even before that, I was applying to internships, but I was in this series. But after graduation, though, I've been fully on top applying for jobs. And I had one very strong referral. And they took my interview. I cleared like, the first three rounds. All the technical rounds were done. They got back to me and they were like, yeah, you've cleared all the rounds. The team was happy with your performance. And then there was this visa issue. So sentiment from India. I would need sponsorship. And they were even fine with sponsoring me. But then there was this role that was introduced that you'll have. A company will have to pay 100k for each new person they hire. So for a little bit, they were quiet. I had no response from them. And I was cleared later that for students who studied here, who did their masters, who run student visa. They wouldn't need to pay 100k. So they got back to me about it, and they were like, yeah, you're all fine. We'll just talk to the managers and arrange the next rounds. And that's it. It's been complete silence. It's been two months. Not respond, and it was a very strong referral, honestly.  
Me: Disappointing. Yeah, I definitely had a few of those that came close myself and then didn't materialize. Neptune, you invest so much your own time, and you go through all these rounds of interviews. And then just feel like you're totally out of control of what happens. So frustrating. How many different jobs do you think you've applied to in that time?  
Them: I've tried data engineer, software engineer and a lot of internships. These were the two I was mostly focusing on. But now I feel like maybe I should broaden everything and I should take up any role I would get.  
Me: Yeah. I spoke with a recruiter. Actually, several different recruiters, and this might be helpful. He says that he has a very hard time filling very specific roles. And that he might have a specific skill set that he really needs. And finding that skill set is really difficult. And what? It might be interesting for you to find some high demand specialties. That aren't so broad and say, I'm going to spend some time learning every nook and cranny of this specific thing. Maybe it's like an older technology that not a lot of people use. You more like. I don't even know, a Cobalt or something. I don't know. Right. But if you had some experience in that and could go to the table and say, oh, yeah, I know this really well, and I could go in here. And showcase this. And I might be early in my career, but I could focus on this with the. Well, that could be a way. But then you're hyper focused. You have to find those specific jobs. But if you're willing to go anywhere in the US and you're high value, that could be an angle for you to look at as well. So what do you think is. The most annoying part of this whole process? Is it just the fact that you're applying and that you never hear back, or is it just, like, you feel like you're just sending resumes off into a black hole? What is the most frustrating part of this whole process for you?  
Them: So one thing I would say is for a few applications, I send out an application tonight. And by tomorrow morning I have a response that it's a reject. And I have LinkedIn premium, right? So I don't even see anybody who's checked out my profile or anything. So it seems like. And I did tailor my application. So it's almost a good match for the job application. Too. So it should have gone through ATS system. At least it should have passed the test. But then there should be some kind of human who reviewed it, right? And I don't see anything. Like that. It's just a reject. And I don't know what I've been rejected for. What was happening? That I did tailor my resume. That much I'm pretty sure about. And still it's a reject with no human. Who checked out the resume? So is the job post actually a real one or is it fake? Or what's happening? I didn't understand that one.  
Me: Yeah. On that topic, a few of the recruiters that I have spoken with have admitted to me flat out that a lot of companies will post fake jobs. To promote themselves and to make themselves look more successful than they are.  
Them: No.  
Me: So that is absolutely happening. I can confirm that, which is super frustrating. But again, the reality of capitalism, I suppose.  
Them: No. It is.  
Me: And you said that you look on LinkedIn. What other platforms are you using to look for opportunities?  
Them: I'm using job right AI and Glassdoor. I'm not using LinkedIn for job search, but I'm just using it to talk to people.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: But I'm mostly using job. Right AI and glassdoor. Especially because I would need sponsorships to be able to stay here and work. So I have three years of time before I can work without a sponsorship, right? So I was just looking for companies that would sponsor me, and I was thinking about long term. So job right. Gave me this filter where I could search for companies that would sponsor me and that the job post that matched my skills exactly. So that one was a good platform, I would say.  
Me: And I'm going to go back to the networking things like you had said that you've been trying to what does trying to network look like in your world? So how are you doing that today, if at all? You mentioned some attempts that have failed, but what does that look like more specifically?  
Them: Two. Right. So I haven't spoken to anybody in person. But I will try and reach out to people on LinkedIn. So first, if you ask me what my dream company is or where I want to work for, what I want to work for, so I Spotify. So I've gone to Spotify page. I've looked through people who work there. I've DM'd, I've emailed. There was this one website. I don't remember the name, but I could tell you in a bit. That I used. It gives me the emails, the Spotify emails of people who work there. So I tried to email them. I tried to call email them. I said easily 15 to 20 cold emails to people only who work at Spotify. Didn't work. Not a single response. I understand. Because nobody would respond with a company email. It's not even a personal email. So I thought, maybe that's not working. So Let me try LinkedIn. So I went through LinkedIn, I called YM like again, 50, 20 people who are data engineers or considering from freshers to senior developers. And everybody, I try to talk to them, tell them that I've done a project or I'm actually really interested, or to a few people, I'm like, I don't need a referral. I do not need anything. I just want to talk about if considering my experience, my education level, what kind of roles would you say I'm a match for? Should I be applying to full time roles or should I still consider internships? I'm not even sure where exactly I fit in a market. So at this point, I was just trying to talk to people. I would send out connection requests with a note or I would just try to send an email. Dm. But yeah, that's all I've done. And there's no response. Not to just Spotify. I've done that to a couple of companies that I've seen job postings and that seem interesting to me that would match my resume. And not respond.  
Me: Okay? One of the things that has worked on jumping a little bit ahead to what the project is that we're working on. We have this idea that we're in the early stages of kind of validating where we want to connect. Job seekers, with hiring managers, with students, with mentors, students with potential internships and trying to match people. And one of the things that. We're playing around with is the idea that it should be. There should be no interface to it, so it's not like another app to download. But maybe it's a phone number that you text and you end up texting. Like an AI bot that then responds back to you. Maybe it calls you, does, like a quick interview of you, asks you a few questions. You talk about yourself and then it knows you. And then you can say, hey, I'm looking. For a mentor, or I'm looking for someone who's looking for a data engineer. I'm looking for this. And then it will then reach out to people to say, hey, I have someone looking for a mentor. Would you be interested in speaking with her? Or whatever. And then it's like this system that. Happens all over text message or over WhatsApp. That's at least for right now. One idea that we're exploring. But I'm wondering, is that type of service something that you would consider, like, if that existed and worked through, that means, is that something that's of interest to you?  
Them: It does. So I wanted to tell you about this other one, which is very similar to what you have just explained. There is this other app called Series, if you've heard about it before.  
Me: I haven't. Not that one. I heard of one called.  
Them: Oh. So I've been following them for like a couple months now. It was developed by two year students and they've like, gotten a couple millions of seeding.  
Me: Oh, wow. Really?  
Them: For the company and everything. And they're amazing when it comes to marketing their product, that they're, like the first people I've seen. They're, like, very Gen Z styled and they're not performative at all. At least that's what I've seen there, like being real about everything. They're not just. You know, sugarcoating their words or anything.  
Me: And what was that called again?  
Them: So what? Series serious.  
Me: Okay. All right, I'll move that one up.  
Them: It's the exact one that, like it seems very similar to what you've explained. So it's an app that would work in imessages. You download it or. I'm not sure. I was considering trying it out. But an AI talks to you. And any kind of input you give it. You would ask if you're looking for a friend or if you're looking for someone to connect with these skills. Basically some kind of meaningful connection. It would match with the other person's AI and would set you up with a call or a meeting or anything like that.  
Me: Okay? Interesting.  
Them: Which is kind of what you explained me, right?  
Me: Yeah, it's similar. There's another one that was similar called. Which is. It works with WhatsApp. V O A R D Y A I so that's another one that's similar to what I had described. There's a bunch of new entrants to this kind of. I think everyone realized that LinkedIn is an old school model that is not going to scale to the new way of doing the new way of doing things.  
Them: Right.  
Me: So I think there's a bunch of people that are kind of, like, trying to figure out how that's going to work. And when it comes to something like that, Working over text message is probably not a problematic. Would you ever grant an app like that, like Siri? Like, if you did get onto that, would you grant them access to your calendar?  
Them: Right. Right.  
Me: So that they could see when you're available for meetings. Is that the kind of permission that you would give it, or is it the kind of thing that you'd restrict? You would.  
Them: Right. Imagine if after I get a job, I would probably have a lot of meeting scheduled and everything, that I wouldn't want to kind of check my calendar, right? At this point, everybody's given a lot of information to AI that a calendar wouldn't be a problem at all. So it would just make things easier for me, if anything, that would just check all the available slots and maybe ask me when I'm free. Or maybe book it from me. If I give AI the permission. To even make my life a lot easier, honestly. And I would be willing to connect and talk to people. That's what I've learned. That network is very important.  
Me: Yeah, okay. Well, that's all of my questions. This was super helpful for me, like, thank you for the value that you provided for me. Hopefully, I provided some value to you as well.  
Them: It was actually really valuable. Honestly, I just wanted to talk to someone and see any kind of input I could get. And you gave me a really important one. That the kind of jobs that not a lot of people are applying for. Maybe Cobalt and stuff like that. I might try it out.  
Me: Yeah. If it. If it's. If it doesn't work out, don't blame me, please. Just try to. Just trying to give some ideas, like, any. Any way that I can help, I'd be happy to. And if. If anything comes my way that I think you'd be a good fit for, I'll be happy to send them your way and connect you.  
Them: At all. Thank you so much.  
Me: Again. No, no, I can't make any promises there, but it's great to have you in my own network now. And now that we've spoken face to face, that's more meaningful than most of my thousand connections on LinkedIn, who I probably never talked to before. So it was. It was. It was. Great to meet you.  
Them: Here. The first person I've spoken to rule LinkedIn, so I'll definitely. There's no way I'd forget.  
Me: Wonderful. Well. All right. Awesome. Well, it was. It was great to meet you, and best of luck with everything.  
Them: Thank you so much. I hope it works out.  
Me: Okay? All right. Thank you. Take care.
