Me: Hello.  
Them: Hey, how's it going?  
Me: It's going pretty well. How are you?  
Them: I'm good.  
Me: Awesome. Well, first off, thank you so much for taking the time to agree to talk to me today. Getting people to talk to me about anything seems to be incredibly challenging nowadays, for whatever reason, So I really appreciate it. I'll try not to take up too much of your time. I have a series of questions I'm looking to ask you. And if you have anything for me, I'd also be able to be more than happy to answer those, too.  
Them: Absolutely.  
Me: So I think just kind of starting off, I'd love to hear a little bit about you and kind of what stage you're at in your career and kind of if you've begun looking at either internships or entering the workforce or kind of what stage you're at, I think that maybe that would be a great way for me to level up, and we can go from there.  
Them: Yep. So I'm currently a first year's master's student. This is my first semester, and I am currently looking for internships.  
Me: Yep. So. I'm currently a first year. Master's student. At first. Semester. And. I am currently. Looking for. Internships. Okay? So far. How have you started looking for them? How many have you looked for, applied for? What type responses have you had that type of thing?  
Them: Honestly, just like a lot of applications, I've been trying to get better at networking.  
Me: Honest. Ly just like a lot of. Applic. Ations. I've been trying to. Get better at. Networking.  
Them: So, like, messaging people on LinkedIn, talking to professors, things like that?  
Me: So. Like messaging people. On LinkedIn talking to. Professors. Things like that.  
Them: Yeah. I don't keep track of the number of applications. I do. Just. Cause if I feel like I hear back, I hear back. If I don't, I don't, you know?  
Me: Yeah. I don't. Keep track of. The number. Of applications. I do. Just. Because I feel like I. Hear back. I hear back. I don't. I just, you know.  
Them: Y. Eah.  
Me: Y. Eah.  
Them: Sorry.  
Me: Sorry.  
Them: Was that worth the question?  
Me: No. That's good. Yeah. And like, in terms of, like, so the state you're at, really, you're pretty much focused on internships. Have you done any type of. Sounds like you have them. But just to make sure you haven't done any type of searching for, like, like career type opportunities in a field that would interest you. Is that right?  
Them: I did after I graduated. I graduated from a bachelor's last May, so I was looking for jobs then. But I'm also on an F1 visa right now, so there's a bit of a time crunch for me there.  
Me: I did. After I graduated. I graduated. From a bachelor's. Last may. So I was. Looking for jobs. Then. But I'm. Also. On an f1. Visa right now. So. There's a bit of a time. Crunch. For me there. Got you. Yeah. Okay? What was that? Just going back to that. Like, what was that? I guess, exercise like. And how were you kind of, I guess, what sites were you looking at for opportunities? And what did that kind of process look like for you? And what struggles did you. Did you face when you're going through that?  
Them: I think. Handshake. LinkedIn. Indeed.  
Me: I think. Handshake. LinkedIn. Indeed.  
Them: A couple other job search sites.  
Me: A couple. Other job search. Sites.  
Them: One of the issues that I had was just, like, I'd get a lot of scam calls, scam emails in response to whatever applications I did.  
Me: One of the issues. That I had was just. Like I get a lot. Of. Scam call scam. Emails. Like in response to. Whatever applic. Ations I did.  
Them: And then just, you know, the eternal struggle of just never hearing back after doing, like, 200 applications.  
Me: And. Then just, you know. The eternal struggle. Of just never hearing back. After doing. Like 200 applic. Ations.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. Okay? Yeah. It's surprising every time I hear it. Because, you know, I'm not sure if this will make you feel better or not, but everyone I talk to that's out there looking for any type of work, whether it's full time, contract, internships. Everybody is telling me the same exact story about how it just feels like they're submitting resumes into a void and they either never hear back, or the ones they do hear back from, they get ghosted or something. So unfortunately, that's kind of the norm, which is why I'm doing what I'M doing with the team I'm working with to try to, like, maybe fix some of this. I don't think it's going to be a magic bullet, but maybe we can make a difference. So I think that's a good kind of segue for me into kind of some more of what we're looking to do here. Like we're focused on making more real connections with people as opposed to maybe where you have LinkedIn, where it's this, like. Performative social media platform, Right? Or there's a lot of the connections aren't very meaningful. So I'm wondering, you mentioned wanting to do some more networking. How have you done networking to date? How have you mentioned talking to some professors and things like that about making connections with places that have internships? But what does networking look like for you to date? And what is it that you're looking to do more of in that. In that space?  
Them: I think up until when I graduated from my bachelor's, networking for me was just like LinkedIn.  
Me: I think. Up until when I graduated. From my bach. Elor's networking. For me. Was just, like, linked. In.  
Them: Which again is an issue because it is more of a performative site.  
Me: Which again is. An issue because it is. More of a. Performative site. With.  
Them: With LinkedIn. Also, I found that an issue is that a lot of the job postings aren't actually real job postings.  
Me: LinkedIn. Also, I found. That an issue is that? A lot of. The job postings. Aren't actually. Real job. Postings.  
Them: But yeah.  
Me: But yeah.  
Them: After I started in my master's, I figured I'd talk to more actual people, make more meaningful connections.  
Me: After. I started in my mast. Er's. I figured I'd. Talk to more actual. People. Make more meaningful. Connections.  
Them: I'm also one of the paths I'm considering right now is academia, so talking to my professors about that has been really useful. I've been able to make a couple of closer connections that I was able to in my bachelor's.  
Me: One of the. Paths I'm considering right now. Is academ. Ia. So talking to. My professors about that. Has been really. Useful. I've enabled. To make a couple. Close. R connections. That I was able to. In my bachelor's. Okay? And I guess if you're looking at everything that's been a struggle so far, what do you think? I already know some of the answers, given all the conversations I've had and the way this is going, but I'd like to hear it from you. What are some of the bigger pain points you have when you want to make a connection? And you need to start. I mean, given that LinkedIn is probably one of the only ways to do that. That's commonly adopted. What are some of those struggles that you think you're facing right now with that that make it challenging? I think a lot of the times.  
Them: I think a lot of the times when I try to message people on LinkedIn.  
Me: When I try to. Message people. On LinkedIn.  
Them: I just never get back a response like, I'll go on. Let's say I'm applying to a job, and then I'll see that they're like this, this, and this alumni.  
Me: I just never get. Back a response like, I'll go. On. Let's say I'm applying to a job. And then I'll see that. They're like. This, this and this alumni.  
Them: Who are working at that company and this, this and this roles. So I'll message them. But usually I feel like what happens is people only go on LinkedIn if they are looking for a job.  
Me: Who? Are working at that company. And this is in the. Scrolls. So I'll message them. But usually. I feel like what happens. Is people only. Go on LinkedIn. If they are looking. For a job.  
Them: So generally, like, making connections with people who already have a job and are established doesn't tend to work out very well.  
Me: So. We're generally, like, making. Connections with people. Who already have a job. And are established. Doesn't. Tend to work out very well. Right. I gotcha. Okay? Yeah, that definitely. Let me just see what else I have on my list here. I think I've covered most of what I needed to already. I guess going into we have a couple. As we're looking to build a solution to make meaningful connections between people, we're looking to focus it on local communities. So I guess I'm wondering for you. Do you have a sense of wanting to stay local? I mean, I would imagine with being actively in your program, you need a local internship, but post graduation, are you looking to stay local? Are you looking to travel, go anywhere? Are you looking to maybe stay local but work remotely? Everything's an option. What are your kind of plans for location and community? I guess as you move forward,  
Them: Honestly, at this stage, location isn't my top priority.  
Me: Honest. Ly at this stage. Location isn't. My top priority.  
Them: I would like to stay within some sort of city. I think Buffalo top three are Buffalo, New York City and Chicago is places I'm looking.  
Me: I. Would like to. Stay within some sort of. City. I think. Buff. Alo. Top three or buff. Alo new york city. And chicago. Is. Places of looking. Okay?  
Them: But I'd honestly be happy anywhere.  
Me: And. Honestly be happy. Anywhere. Okay? And then. We're looking at doing this via a little bit of an interesting path where instead of creating an app, We're looking at maybe leveraging existing messaging tools that people already use so that we can, like. I'm just giving an example. You message a phone number. That phone number makes a call to you. When at a time that you're available, you talk to an AI agent, You talk to it about yourself. You're giving information, you're pitching yourself. Basically, it creates a profile on you. Other people have done the same thing, and then you tell it your goals. I'M looking for an internship. I'm looking for a mentor. I'm looking for a job, whatever. And it basically does the matchmaking and then puts you together with someone. So the idea there is that you'd be interfaceless. It's not just another app to download. That's our idea that we're playing around with right now. But with that in mind, what messaging apps are you consistently using or using WhatsApp or Telegram or Discord or just basic iMessage SMS? What are some of those tools that you're using today for messaging?  
Them: That sounds really cool. First of all, that sounds great. I would love to not have to just download another app and, you know, go through all of that again.  
Me: That. Sounds really cool. First of all. That sounds great. I would love to not have. To just download. Another app. And go through all of. That again.  
Them: I use primarily for work related stuff. I use discord sometimes slack depends on depending on if other people are already using it.  
Me: I. Use primarily. For. Work related stuff. I use discord. Sometimes. Slack. Depends on. If other people. Are already using it.  
Them: But, yeah, I'd say Discord is, like, my major main one.  
Me: But yeah. I say discord is. Like my major. Main one. Okay? Yeah, I've heard more and more of that. Lately. Now, is it specific discord communities that you've found and that you're a part of? And I guess if that's the case, how have you found those discord communities?  
Them: Yeah, honestly.  
Me: Yeah. Honestly.  
Them: It's usually just like,  
Me: It's usually just.  
Them: Existing groups or, like, clubs around school.  
Me: Like ex. Isting groups. Or clubs around school.  
Them: Like, for example, all of the TS clubs have a discord. The CS Graduate Students association, they have a discord. So, yeah, basically any clubs, any organizations that I'm part of, they tend to have their own discord server.  
Me: Like for. Example. All of. The cs clubs have a disc. Ord the cs. Grad. Uate students association. They. Have a discord. So yeah. Basically any clubs. Any organization. S that I'm part of. They tend to have. Their own discord. Server.  
Them: So then I just join there.  
Me: Reg. Ister there. Okay? Tune. It out. And then if a system like this did exist to do this kind of matchmaking, one of the things that will be valuable for this app to have is some type of access to your calendar for when it needed it. Right. So, like, if I wanted to compare your schedule with someone that you want to meet with, it can say, hey, it looks like you're available at 3:00 tomorrow. I'll kind of schedule this for you. Is granting access to a calendar something that you'd feel comfortable with, or is that something that you want to keep private and do off, maybe more manually?  
Them: Well, I don't use Google. I just use a paper calendar or just like my notes app, so I don't think that question would be really applicable to me.  
Me: Well, I don't use. I just use a paper calendar. Or. Just like my notes. App. So. I don't think that question. Would be really helpful. To me. Fair enough. And that's why we're asking, Right? So it's like to get those data points. That's not the kind of thing that we would know unless we ask. So that's good feedback.
