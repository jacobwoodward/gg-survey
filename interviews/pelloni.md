Me: Hi, cliff.  
Them: Hey, how you doing?  
Me: Hey. How you doing, Jake? I'm doing fantastic. I wanted to start by saying thank you so much for agreeing to speak with me. It means the world to me. It's been so hard to get people to actually talk face to face. Nobody wants to do that anymore. No one wants to talk. Everyone just wants to look. At their funnel and live in their own little bubble, I guess.  
Them: Jake. Nobody wants to do that anymore. I don't know. Sure.  
Me: So it means a lot to me, so thank you. I'm going to start there. So something about my email must have resonated with you, and I wanted to maybe start there. So what about what I said was interesting to you?  
Them: Well.  
Me: Well.  
Them: I don't remember the exact numbers. It was either 1,000 or 4,000 applications or something, right?  
Me: I. Don't remember the exact numbers. It was either 1000 or. 4000 applications or something. Right.  
Them: And so I came out of corporate, like, 15 years ago.  
Me: I came out of corporate, like, 15 years ago.  
Them: I worked with companies at all different level startups, mid size Fortune 4, sold medical software and other things like that. McTESIN Right.  
Me: I worked. With companies at all different level startups, Mid Size Fortune 4 sold medical software and things like that, right?  
Them: And then my wife and I had our first child. He had a bilateral cleft up in palladium. He's doing great.  
Me: And then my wife and I, our first child, we had bilateral clubs up in Paladin. Doing great.  
Them: But there was operations and PT and speech and all that stuff. So one of us had to come out. So I created a video marketing agency.  
Me: But there was operations and PT and speech on this stuff. So one of us had to come out. So I created a video market agency, morphed into a publishing company, right? And so now he's going to be 20 here, Charlotte Lee. Maybe one more operation. So I'm like, you know what? It's time to get back into corporate.  
Them: Morphed into a publishing company, right? And so now he's going to be 20 here shortly. Maybe one more operation. So I'm like, you know what? It's time to get back into corporate. Now.  
Me: Now, even though I look great, I'm 60.  
Them: Even though I look great, I'm 60. So. As you know, it's difficult enough.  
Me: As you know, it's. Difficult enough.  
Them: Without ageism. But the fact is, I got a spare background.  
Me: Without ageism. But the fact is, I got a spare background.  
Them: I've got a lot of tremendous corporate experience. VP of sales, regional vp, that type of thing. And then my entrepreneurial experience.  
Me: I've got a lot of tremendous corporate experience. EPA sales, regional vp, that type of thing, and then entrepreneurial experience.  
Them: And that encompasses things like marketing, organization, client satisfaction, all that stuff.  
Me: And that encompasses things like marketing, organization, client satisfaction, all that stuff. So I even engaged a couple firms that were like, will help you get yourself back together.  
Them: So I even engaged a couple firms that were like, how will help you get yourself back together? And they're like, well, instead of saying, hey, what am I good at? They're, oh, no, you're in demand.  
Me: And they're like, well, instead of saying, hey, what am I good at? They're like, oh, no, you're in demand.  
Them: And that was the first lie. Second was like, well, just tell me what you like to do, because that's what you want to do. So they're all marketing. Well, didn't have the Martech stack that big companies use, Right. So we go and over the course of probably three years, off and on, because I have to do client work and stuff. I probably submitted three, 400 times to different things. I've probably had three interviews. One of them was four interviews. One was from referral, right?  
Me: And. That was the first. Lie. Second was like, well, just tell me what you like to do, because that's what you want to do. So that's all marketing. Well, doesn't have the Martech stack. That the companies use, right? So. We go. And over the course. Of probably three years. Off and on. Because I have to do client work and stuff. I probably submit 300, 400 times to different things. I probably had. Three interviews. One of them. Was four interviews. One was from referral. Right.  
Them: And I've realized I'm probably best in the customer satisfaction space.  
Me: And. I realized. I'm probably best in the customer satisfaction. Space. But.  
Them: But.  
Me: I have one.  
Them: I have one where a lady I used to work with created the company and I was perfect for the role past all their tests.  
Me: Where a lady. Used to work with. Create the company. And. I was. Perfect for the role. Past. All their tests.  
Them: And it was just.  
Me: And it was just like.  
Them: You're overqualified. Why would you want to work for this amount? And I'm like, well, I see what you guys are doing. I want more flexibility, that whole type of thing. I just see that a lot. So that's resonated with me. It's just so painful, and it's. Broken. I mean, just so broken.  
Me: You're qualified, why would you want to work for this amount? And I'm like, well. I see what you guys are doing. I want more flexibility. That whole type of thing. I just see that a lot, so that's resonated with me. It's just so painful, and it's broken. I mean, just. So broken. Yeah. I'm 45. And I would say I've clearly experienced a magism myself. Right. It's just like there used to be this corporate ladder that you would climb and keep getting more and more experience. And then somewhere along the way, that ladder started to crumble. For the more people I talked to, the more I'm seeing this happening, not just to me, but everywhere. And this whole process of talking to people has been really eye opening.  
Them: Yeah. Y. Eah. Yep.  
Me: And there's some comfort in knowing that you're not alone. But at the same time, it's like there needs to be something better. Like we can't just accept that it's just broken and there's nothing we can do about it. Right? And the job boards, the same old thing about optimizing for the job boards and the cash systems and all that stuff. And they're like, well, just go post one content on LinkedIn and try to network that way. And I'm like,  
Them: Right, right. And the job boards, you know, the same old thing about, you know, optimizing for the job boards and, you know, the test systems and all that stuff, and they're like, well, you know, just go post content on LinkedIn and try to network that way, and I'm like, you know. I might as well go into the mall and say, hey, I've got a resume. You want to look at me? I mean, it's. And to your point, I've seen a lot of people. Some friends recently got released in the early 50s from at, and you'd think that he was in a you. Know, 20 years there. Great. Well liked.  
Me: I might as well go into the mall and say, hey, I've got a resume. You want to look at me. And to your point, I've seen a lot of people, some friends recently got released in the early 50s. From AT and you'd think that he was in. 20 years. There. Great. Well liked.  
Them: It positioned that he would be. It would be easier for him to transfer. No, there's crickets. I mean, it's just crickets.  
Me: Position that he. Would be easier for him to transfer. No, there's crickets. I mean, it's just crickets. Yeah. So I'd like to just ask a couple questions about what your search has looked like. Or, well, maybe not the search. Let's talk about, like, because I think that we've probably both realized that just submitting resumes into the black hole is not working and that any opportunities that we do find are going to come from connections that we have or people that we meet or whatever. So what does networking look like for you today, either in person, online, like, how are you meeting people? How are you getting yourself out there? And I guess the second part of that question is, what about that process is painful right now? All of it. But specifically then you're into the same part first. Yeah, it is all painful, right?  
Them: Well, I think you answered the second part first. Yeah, it is all painful, right? Like everybody else.  
Me: Like everybody else.  
Them: I'll go through my old contacts. I went through my old corporate contacts and on some of these people, percentage of it, because it's been. Because, you know, I've been out of corporate for quite a while.  
Me: I go. Through my little contacts. I went through my own corporate contacts. Now, some of these people are percentage of it because it's been because I've been undercover. For quite a while.  
Them: You know, they've retired. So then it really, you know, useful. I mean, you know, and this way it is. And the other ones are like, yeah, you know, I'd love to. Let me know.  
Me: They've retired. So then. It's really useful. Way. And the other ones are. Like, yeah. I'd love to. Let me know.  
Them: I'll look around. They're busy. You know what? They're busy and they're concerned about their position anyway.  
Me: I'll. Look around. They're busy. You know what? They're busy. And. They're concerned about their position anyway.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Right.  
Them: So, like, I've got a friend.  
Me: So I've got a friend.  
Them: You know? Works at a high level corporation.  
Me: At a high level corporation.  
Them: There's a position that was open.  
Me: There's a position that was open.  
Them: He. He. He said, hey, look, interview my friend. He knew the person within. Within it.  
Me: He said, hey, look, interview my friend. You knew the person within it.  
Them: And I think just because I didn't personally, because I did match the ideal candidate role, there wasn't even interview. So I think some of that stuff, the context that you even have now, they're concerned about keeping their positions and what's going to happen to them. So, yes, they would want to help. You. But it's. But it's.  
Me: And I think. Just because. Personally because. You did mention. The ideal. Candidate. Role. There wasn't even. Interview. So I think some of that stuff. The context that you even have. Now they're concerned about keeping their positions and what's going to happen to them. So, yes, they would want to help you. But.  
Them: It's almost like. I don't say pulling teeth or. There's not as much leverage as you used to get. When I think in the past when it was, hey, this guy's really good. I think you should talk to him.  
Me: It's almost like I don't say colon, Keith. Or there's not as much leverage that you used to get. When I think in the past, When it was. This guy's really good. I think Shitake know that type of thing.  
Them: You know, that type of thing. You know, I've got a neighbor right up the street, and she's. I've been marketing in a company that's five miles away from where we're at, and. But what happens is you still got to go through the process, right? So someone who's known forties, fifties.  
Me: I've been marketing in a company. That's five miles away from where we're at. But what happens is you still got to go through the process, right? So someone who's known forties, fifties.  
Them: You get a referral.  
Me: You get? A referral.  
Them: It goes to someone whose job is just to filter. You know, they, they still, they still aren't bypassing that, that piece. And, you know, sometimes they go to hiring manager, they just take it back to HR because they don't want to. They, you know, they want to follow the procedure now.  
Me: It goes to someone. Whose job is to filter. They still aren't bypassing that piece. And sometimes they go to hiring manager, they just take it back to HR because they don't want to. They want to follow the procedure now.  
Them: And from an hr standpoint,  
Me: And from an hr standpoint,  
Them: It's like if you don't. If you don't check all the boxes and then. And then have all this other stuff.  
Me: If you don't check all the boxes and then have all this other stuff.  
Them: You're not even going to get, you know, look at, so.  
Me: You then need to. Get a look at. I think that's a really good perception. It's the first time I've heard anyone articulate the idea of self preservation as one of the factors that they think could be affecting why connections aren't materializing. And I'm surprised that that's the first time I'VE heard it because I think that's a big part of it. I think that people will get a certain amount of social capital to use, like in their positions, and they're becoming more and more cautious to use that social capital because they fear that they might be next. Because I think that nobody feels safe anymore because loyalty has become pointless on both sides of it. Right? They're like, right. That's really interesting.  
Them: Right. Yeah. Where did you said over the course. Did you actually submit 4,000 resumes?  
Me: You said over the course, did you actually submit 4,000 resumes? Did you? I would say from the Business Insider, when that article was published, I was at about 15 to 1600. And after that it was another probably 4 or 500. So I'm well over 2000. Really? Two or four, yeah. And I did join a venture studio as a contractor two months ago, and I've been working with them, and they're working on this project.  
Them: Did you or. Okay? That was good. I remember. See where it happened? Two or four. Yeah.  
Me: That is about networking and trying to solve the issue of there's, like, a lack of real human connection happening professionally anymore, and everything is performative, and for the algorithm and all this ghosting is happening and that no real connections are happening. So the project that they kind of had me on now is this idea of, maybe doing professional matchmaking to say, like, okay, person A needs this. Person V needs this. You guys can help each other. Let me put you together and let's, you know, try to foster some type of real connections between people, whether it's not just about job search, but just about, you know, whether it's. Mentoring or whatever. There's all these different reasons to connect with people, and we're trying to, like, look at ways to kind of maybe find some way to solve that. Because I think right now, no one's really doing a good job of solving this problem, and everyone feels resigned, like, okay, this is just the way it is, right? I know the deal.  
Them: Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Yes. I mean, I mean, you know the deal. You know, it's like, you know, you can, you can. There's, you know, 500 people submit to a position on LinkedIn or, or if there's a cover letter required, maybe there's 50. But then you got to take the time to, to match. The cover letter. I. You know, I got one interview with Georgia Tech.  
Me: There's 500 people submit to a position on LinkedIn. Or if there's a cover letter required, maybe there's 50. But then you have to take the time to match the cover letter. I got one interview with Georgia Tech, which I'm in Atlanta North.  
Them: Which I'm in Atlanta north, you know, suburb of Atlanta. And I went through. Went to the interviews and they. And actually, you know, they were like, hey, you were great. We just had a candidate that met close, so that was, like, the first time that actually you went through the whole process.  
Me: And. I went through went to. The interviews. And actually they were like, hey, you were great. We just had a candidate that met. Close. So it was like the first time. That actually, you went through the whole process.  
Them: And they were professional enough to say thanks, but we got somebody else that matched better. You were really great. If we can help you out, you know, in the future, that type of thing.  
Me: And they were professional enough to say thanks, but we got somebody else that matched very rurally. Great. We can help you out. In the future, that type of thing. Right.  
Them: But the ghosting is just crazy. There was, you know, there was a position that I interviewed for, and there was, I think, three people. Three people that they interviewed for.  
Me: But the ghosting is just crazy. There was a position that I interviewed Bohr, and there was, I think, three people. Three people that did interview for. And she's like, man.  
Them: And she's like, man, you. You know, if you don't, I'm going to reach out to this person because there's the HR person, and if not, I think it'd be really good for this role, too.  
Me: I'm going to reach out. To this person. Because. There was the HR person, and if not, I think it'd be really good for this role. Too.  
Them: All right.  
Me: And I.  
Them: Great.  
Me: Agree.  
Them: Never heard from her again.  
Me: Never heard from. Her again.  
Them: You know, follow up with email, followed up with LinkedIn messages, you know, so I think.  
Me: Follow email followed up with LinkedIn messages. And that's important. That is the norm, I think.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I would say roughly half of the interviews that I went on that were legit, half of them ghosted me afterwards. It's insane. I don't know how that's acceptable, but somehow it is. I think it's true. I think one, everybody just so covered up.  
Them: Well, I think it's true. I think one everybody just so covered up. And I think that. That there's. That's just a thing. And then I think it's just a lack of professionalism that.  
Me: And I think. That. 's just. A thing. And then I think it's just a lack. Of. Professionalism.  
Them: 's creeped into corporate. And then, and this might be reverse ageism, but some of the age of the people that are handling that type of thing.  
Me: It's creeped into. Corporate. And then. It might be reverse ageism, but some of the age of the people that are handling that type of thing.  
Them: Have grown up in a.  
Me: Have grown up. In. A different environment.  
Them: Different environment. Social media, the type of thing where they can hide behind their social media, right?  
Me: Social media, that type of thing where they can hide behind. Their social media, right? If we're not going to use you, why do I need to bother?  
Them: And. And so. And so it's like, if we're not going to use you, why do I need to bother to. To connect with you?  
Me: To connect with you. Yeah. And I think that my perception, being in the middle there, is that I could see where it's almost gone. And yes, there's the younger generation is natively like that. But then I also look at my parents who are retired and how they are just also sucked into that they're on Facebook, like, all day long. Both of them, right? It's like they're getting all of their media curated by their interests and going further and further into their own little silos on different things.  
Them: Right. Right. Yes. Oh, yeah. All right. Yeah.  
Me: And encountering the same. They're saying things online that they would never say to another human being face to face. Right. So that same thing is creeping into every aspect of life, unfortunately.  
Them: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I'll take. This. Yeah.  
Me: It's really interesting. I'm trying to think what other questions I had for you. I've really covered what I wanted to, and I wanted to be respectful of your time. I'm good for election time if you want. Yeah, I mean, I think I'm wondering about.  
Them: I'm good. I'm good for the extra time, if you want. So we've got some questions.  
Me: LinkedIn? Specifically, how much do you find yourself using LinkedIn? Are you out there seeking new types of connections? Are you looking for introductions to certain types of people? Are you just like looking for hiring managers at companies when you see a job post? How are you using LinkedIn today?  
Them: Three. Sure. So, so two things. One, we have a publishing company, book coaching company. And so I've morphed to use the LinkedIn for that. But before that, when LinkedIn for me was, was was just, you know, career corporate type of thing.  
Me: So two things. One. I have a publishing company, book coaching company. And so I've morphed to use the LinkedIn for that. But before that when LinkedIn for me, career corporate type of thing.  
Them: I actually, you know, did some automated software to reach out to connections within certain, you know, avenues. Just from a connection standpoint, if there was a job opening somewhere that I liked, I would look for. I would look for someone who would. Who was in that similar role at the company and reach out to them to see if they would, you know, hey, look, you know, I'm looking at Opportunity Company.  
Me: I actually did some automated software to reach out to connections within certain avenues. Just from a connection standpoint, if there was a job opening somewhere that I liked, I would look for someone who was in that similar role. At the company and reach out to them. To see if they look. I'm looking at Opportunity Company.  
Them: You know, just one. I'd love to get your in, you know, input or your opinion or something. Could we have like a. Would you open to like a, you know, 10 minute chat or something like that?  
Me: I'd love to get your input or your opinion or something. Can we have until like 10 minute chat or something like that? Some people are really great.  
Them: Some people were really great. I think there was one guy that was just not only. But see, this was the individual. It was. He was just open anyway.  
Me: I think. There was one guy that was just. Not only. But see, this was the individual. He was just open anyway.  
Them: But he gave me. He's like. Like you'd be really great for the role. Here's what. If you're interviewing with my boss, here's what she likes. What she doesn't like, she'd prep me. That was the ideal type of connection.  
Me: But he gave. Me. Could you be really great for the role? If you interviewed my boss. Here's what she likes, what she doesn't like. That was the ideal type of connection.  
Them: You know, and I interviewed the Boston, and then I didn't go anywhere.  
Me: And I interviewed the boss and then didn't go anywhere.  
Them: But, you know, it's.  
Me: But. It's engaged in a course that basically says we can get you placed, Right. And.  
Them: Engaged in a course that basically says we can get you placed. Right. And they're big thing.  
Me: Their big thing.  
Them: You know, beyond.  
Me: Beyond.  
Them: The correcting you for the interview and focusing on what you should be saying. And all that resumes and LinkedIn was go out and build connections, just build connections. And.  
Me: The trucking for the interview and focusing on what you should be saying. And all that resumes and LinkedIn was go out and build connections, just build connections.  
Them: You know, I feel to a degree that's kind of a waste of time.  
Me: And I feel like, to a degree, that's kind of a waste of time.  
Them: Maybe for people like if you have a. If you have a. A niche.  
Me: Maybe. For people like if. You have a. Niche. Industry. So, like, if you're.  
Them: Industry. So, like, if you're a engineer for manufacturing in this industry, or if you're a finance guy that did this type of thing, so really niche. So it would be more like, hey,  
Me: An engineer. For manufacturing in this industry or if you're a finance guy that did this type of thing. So really niche. So it would be more like.  
Them: You know, it would make sense to connect with those type of people.  
Me: It would make sense to connect with those type of people.  
Them: Because.  
Me: Because.  
Them: You know, they. You. You might be able to offer them something at some point.  
Me: You. Made a lot of redemption. Something at some point.  
Them: But, you know, for, for different roles where I was looking at sales executives or VP of sales or marketing or customer, customer satisfaction, you know, customer management.  
Me: Right, but for different roles, where I was looking at sales executives or VP of sales or marketing or customer satisfaction. Customer management.  
Them: There's no really value for these people unless they personally are open to that type of thing.  
Me: There's no really value for these people. Unless they personally are open to that type of thing.  
Them: And they're probably getting pounded anyway.  
Me: And they're probably getting pounded anyway. Right? Yeah. Right. It's like, most of the time, I think that people are. The only time people are reaching out to them is when they want something and have nothing to offer in return. And I think that makes people feel jaded by the entire process. They just think that every time someone's reaching out to me. They must want something, right? Right. If I'm reaching out to somebody specifically about a company or something like that.  
Them: Right. Right. Right. Right. If I'm reaching out to somebody specifically about a company or something like that.  
Me: What could I do for you? There's nothing I can do for you. Right. So maybe from a different approach for a while, it was like, look, I'm looking for my next ideal, my next ideal role. Identified. Your company is one of the ones that would love to work for.  
Them: It's more general than it is about the specific role.  
Me: It's more general. Than it is about the specific role.  
Them: Right. And so I think that might be a more value. But again, if you get knocked off, you're unemployed.  
Me: And so I think that might be a more value. But again, If you get knocked off. You're unemployed.  
Them: And you get a certain amount of time or you got a certain package or something, you need some more. You need resources, right? I mean, you need some. Not general networking. So I think that's problem is that some people don't do that. They should be doing that.  
Me: And you get a certain amount of time or you got a certain package or something. You need some more? You need resources. Right? I mean, you need some. Not general networking. So I think that's problem is that some people don't do that, basically do that.  
Them: When they're employed. But we're too busy. We're too busy doing work.
