Me: Good morning.  
Them: Good morning.  
Me: Good. Morning.  
Them: How are you?  
Me: How are you? I'm doing very well. How are you?  
Them: I'm good, thank you.  
Me: Thank you. First off, thank you so much for meeting with me to talk about this stuff. I really appreciate it. Finding people to talk to has been very difficult. So it means a lot to me that we want to take a few minutes out of your day and chat with me. So thank you very much.  
Them: Definitely. This is something very important for me. I think it's just almost like venting, so I'm completely happy to do this.  
Me: All right. Wonderful. Well, thank you. So I figure what would be a good way for me to start is just to give you a minute or two. To introduce yourself to me, tell me at what point you are in your schooling and career and if you've done any internships yet or if you started looking for work yet and entering the career force. Just a snapshot to get us started would be a great way to get going.  
Them: So great. I actually completed my Bachelor's in 2022in Computer Science and Engineering. I took two years after that to work in corporate industry. I worked with a company called Emphasis. I worked for two years where I was a specialist programmer.  
Me: Okay? I actually. Completed my. Bachelor's in. 2,022. In community science. And engineering. I took. Two years after. That to work. In corporate industry. I worked. With a company called Emphas. Is I worked two years. Where I was a special. Ist programmer.  
Them: Senior software developer. And then I started my master's, and even before I was graduating, I was like a freelancer for two years.  
Me: Senior soft. Ware developer, and then I started. My master. And. Even before. When I was graduating. I was like, A freelancer for two. Years.  
Them: So I've been working for around four years, and then I did my master's, where I did absolutely no work other than masters.  
Me: So I've been working. For around. Four years, and then. I get my master? 's where I take. Absolutely no work. Other than masters. And.  
Them: And then. Yeah, I think I finished my last class on Friday. I'm done with my master's now. And I'm in this. Thank you. And I'm in this place.  
Me: Then I think. I finished my. Last class. On Friday. I'm done with. My master's now. Congratulations. Thank you. And I'm on. The previous.  
Them: Where I am constantly applying every single day and maintaining a tally for every job I put in. So I think I'm around 2,000 jobs.  
Me: I'm constantly app. Lying every single day. And maintaining. A candle for every. Job I put in. So I think. I'm around 2000. Jobs.  
Them: In the past one and a half month of me documenting it. Apart from documenting it, I don't know how many jobs I'm in. And last summer I was still doing Internship hunt. Zero results.  
Me: In the past. One and a half months. Of me documenting. It apart from. Documenting. It. I don't know how many job. S. I'm in. And last summer I. Was still doing. Internship. Hunt. Zero results.  
Them: Probably 2000 applications there as well.  
Me: Prob. Ably 2000 applic. Ations. There as well.  
Them: But only one interview that didn't pan out well, and no internship.  
Me: But. Only one interview. That did fan out. Well and. No internship.  
Them: But here we are now.  
Me: But. Okay?  
Them: Seriously.  
Me: Yeah. It's definitely a strange time right now in the workforce. And that's kind of the point of having this conversation, because we're seeing a lot of this. I guess it's not just you, if that makes you feel any better. I don't know if it does or doesn't, but it seems like that's what everyone is experiencing right now. So that's kind of the premise of why we're talking today. I don't have the answers, but I'm trying to learn more so that I can maybe start on working on something with the team I'm working with to come up with something. So with that being said, I want to kind of dive into. Actually, you already covered a few of my questions already, organically. But you said 2000. Over the past few months, have you been what level of customization of resumes and things like that have you been doing. Do you like custom tailor resumes for the opportunities or using one resume? What are you doing there in terms of how to, I guess, adapt to the way the system's been changing?  
Them: Right. So definitely ats is an absolute thicker.  
Me: Right. So defin. Itely ats is. An absolute. Ticker. And.  
Them: And most of the time, when it comes to mango companies, because I'm in the tech field, I definitely customize my resume for all the mango companies. For that, I do it for sure.  
Me: Most of the time. When. It comes to. Mango companies. Because I'm in the. Tech field. I definitely. Customize my resume. For all the manual companies. For that. I do it for? Shop when it comes to.  
Them: When it comes to other companies that are not as prevalent or I know that it's not going to be as competitive. I used to be an IV and after thinking that it's not going to be that competitive, but every company is competitive now.  
Me: Other. Companies that are. Not as. Prevalent or. I know that. It's not going to. Be as competitive. I used to be an. Ideal. Company that examined. Me that competitor. But every company is. Competent. Now.  
Them: What I do is I actually have four different resumes. So one is going to be my master resume, which is like almost everything I've done is there on it.  
Me: What I do is. I actually have. Four tips and. So one is going to be my. Master se. Ma. Which is like, almost. Everything I've done. Is. There on it.  
Them: Then I have a master resume for sde, which includes all my development projects.  
Me: Then I have a mast. Er resume. Called sd. Which. On my developer. Project.  
Them: Then there is one for all my machine learning projects.  
Me: Then there is one. For all my machine. Learning project. S.  
Them: That is my ML master resume. And then there is one for data engineering.  
Me: That is. My ML mascul. Ine resume. And then there is one foot. Data.  
Them: So these three, since these three are my fields and I've worked on it extensively, I only focus on these three fields and these three roles. So I have these three that I usually sometimes or almost all the time, they have all the words that they require. Because, honestly, what they're asking is the same, apart from the years of experience.  
Me: So. These three syn. Cs vcr. My. Favorite. On it extensively. I only focus on. These features. And these. Three. Roles. So I have. History that I. Usually. Sometimes almost all the. Time. They have all. The. Required because. Honestly. Asking is the. Same, apart from the years of. Experience.  
Them: So most of them have almost the same content when it comes to my work experience, but it's the projects that are different for all of them.  
Me: So most of them. Have almost the same. Content. When it comes to my work experience. But. It's the project. That I be. Gin for all of them.  
Them: Because I can't really change my work experience. I mean, I have to be honest.  
Me: Because. I can't. Really change. My work. Experience. I mean, I have to be. Honest.  
Them: That's where I work.  
Me: That's what I. Was.  
Them: So I can't do that much about that. But I know that I can change the project for Mango. It's completely different for all the Mango companies.  
Me: So I can't do. That much about that. But I know that I can change the. Product. For mango. It's completely different. So all the mango. Companies.  
Them: I make sure that all my points, even the bullets, for my experience, are tailored to what they're actually looking for.  
Me: I. Make sure that all my. Points. Or even the bul. Lets for my experience. Are tailored to. What they're actually looking for.  
Them: So for those I work extensively because that's just a dream.  
Me: So. For those. I work extensively. Because. That. 's just a dream.  
Them: And everything else.  
Me: And everything else.  
Them: I have, like, four resumes. Usually one of them just fits the brief and I just upload.  
Me: I. Have, like, four. Resumes. Usually one of. Them just fixed the brief. And I just observed. Gotcha. Okay? And then have you been doing any type of. Networking, trying to introduce yourself to the right people. Have you? I guess. And the second part of that question, have you successfully built any relationships that you found valuable? I guess as my next question,  
Them: So I think I'm slightly lucky here because I have a sister and a brother in law right now here in the US one is working for Amazon, one is working for Walmart. They've been in the area for around nine years now. So they've had pretty good relationships and connections who are just free. To refer me. They're like, yeah, she's like our sister. We'll just put in. So for me, that has been easy. At least all the Mango companies. I've had reference directly come in. And previously, when I was working with Infosys, my client was actually Apple.  
Me: I. Think I'm slightly lucky here. Because. I have a. Sister and a private in. Law, right? Now. Here in the us. Working for Amazon. For walmart. They've been. In the area for around. Nine years. Now. So. They have had pretty good. Relationships and. Connections who are. Just free to back up. She? Lves. Put in. So for me, that. Has completely. At least all the. Manual companies I've had. Reference direct. Ly come in and. Previously when I was. Working with infos. Ys my client was actually. Apple.  
Them: So my boss's boss was the vp of apple in india.  
Me: So. My boss, of course. Was uc. Or apple in india.  
Them: He's also very good when it comes to referring and then putting my word name across the board.  
Me: You. Go to. Very good when you come to. Accident. Putting. My word. Name across. The board.  
Them: And with that, I've been pretty good. Where I've been trying to do is actually I'm just reaching out to recruiters now directly. I'm trying to build a network with technical recruiters, because as much as I think that these people have a bigger vote because they're in higher roles, I feel like technical recruiters are the people who are actually going to push you in the right doors. Because earlier on, one of my sister's friends was in Microsoft, and she's like, VP or something, and she preferred me, and then I still got rejected, like, within a day.  
Me: And. With that. I. 've been pretty good. Where I've been. Trying to do is actually. I'm. Just reaching out to rec. Ruiters. Now. Directly. I'm trying to build a network. With technical recruiter. S. Because. As much as I. Think. That these people have. A bigger. Role because they're. In higher roles. I technical? Tech Rotors are the people. Who are actually going to. Push you in the right. Doors. Because. Earlier. On one of my. Sisters for experts. In Microsoft and. She's like. You or something. And she would. Be in the max. Ill got rejected. Like within the. Day.  
Them: And the reason was I later connected with the recruiter and she was like, oh, yeah, you're not going to get shortlisted for that because you're still in university. That is for someone who's already graduated. She didn't know that. I didn't know that, but they did know that, so maybe. This is different. Maybe I should have more connections in technical directing.  
Me: And. The reason. Was. I even considered was a. Recruiter. And she was like, oh, yeah. You're not going to get shortlisted. For that because you're still in. University. That is for. Someone who's already exam. Ining. She didn't know that. I didn't know that. But. They didn't know that. So. Maybe. This is different. Maybe I should. Have more connection. S and technical assist. Ance.  
Them: So I just have connected with a lot of people. Roblox, Microsoft, Tesla, all these people that are quite easy to find on LinkedIn.  
Me: I. Understand happen, I think. With a lot of people. Go blogs. Or. Tesla. All these people that. 's not easy to find on. LinkedIn. I'm just.  
Them: I just connect, and I'm like, hi.  
Me: Like. Hi.  
Them: I'm graduating. It'll be great if I could get a job.  
Me: I'm. Graduating. Did you be great? If I could.  
Them: So that's how I've been building mostly on this front.  
Me: Talk. Okay? And then. Everyone. I asked this question to you has always given me the same answer. So I wonder if yours will be different. But are you looking locally, hoping to work locally, looking nationwide, willing to move anywhere, looking to live locally, work remotely? What? You're open to everything. What's your current situation?  
Them: My go to face these days has been even the other day I was telling someone, beggars can't be choosers. I am someone who's open to anything, anywhere, anytime, anything. I'm just open to everything. I don't think there is any website that I haven't been fiddling around. With. I'm applying to everything. 43 knot LinkedIn job, right? Y Combinator. Well found. Ziprecruiter. Simplify indeed. Built in all of them. Literally all of them.  
Me: My. Waterfall. Hasn't even been. I. Am only one. Year open to anything. Anywhere, any. Time. Any. Thing. I'm just open to. Everything. I don't think there is. Any. Website that I have. N't. Filmed fiddling around. With. I'm applying to. Everything, motri. Na lindisfell. Job, right? Y combinat. Or welfare. Zipro. Ot. Simplify. Ind. Eed. Built in. All of it. Literally all. Yeah. Okay? That's consistent with what everyone has been saying. I think everyone I've talked to so far has all said that some variation of beggars can't be choosers. Right? It's just like wherever the job is going to be, I'm going to go because that's what I need. To do to survive in this world, right?  
Them: Yeah. Because it's not like they are looking for us. We're looking for them at this point.  
Me: It's not. Looking. For a reason. For them at this point. Right.  
Them: They have an ocean. We barely have a pond.  
Me: They have an. Ocean. We. Currently have a bond. Right. Yeah, definitely. That's definitely consistent. You mentioned LinkedIn. What exactly do you use LinkedIn for? Do you find it effective for any purposes? I think that's kind of one of the. Because given that it's like the only professional social network that has any type of widespread adoption is why I'm asking about it. But how do you use it, and do you find it effective?  
Them: Honestly speaking, I don't think I find LinkedIn effective just genuinely because they have very stale postings. I don't know, most of the time the postings that are on LinkedIn.  
Me: Honestly. Speaking. I don't think I find. Anything. Effective. Because. They have. Very sales. Postings. I don't know. Most of the time. The postings that. Are on and. Expense.  
Them: Has already been on some other website.  
Me: Has. Already explained. On some other cons. Ult.  
Them: They've either been on one of the other direct role postings or something, direct career pages or something, but it's pretty stale.  
Me: One. Of the other. Connect. Ors. Or something. Direct to their pages. Or something. But it's pretty. Scary.  
Them: And LinkedIn Easy Apply makes it easy for me and another 30,000 people. It's really not helpful.  
Me: And. LinkedIn is like. Makes it easy. For me. And another. 30,000. People. Extraordinary.  
Them: And when it comes to connections.  
Me: And. When it comes to. Connection. S.  
Them: Sometimes it's a little creepy as well, because most propositions are not just for jobs.  
Me: Sometimes. It's a little creep. Y as well. Because. Most. Populations. Are not just.  
Them: They just talk about random things, which, honestly, is not even what I'm looking for.  
Me: They just. Talk about random. Things. Which, honestly. Is not even what I'm looking. First.  
Them: So.  
Me: So.  
Them: I try to wind down what I'm searching for. Most of the time, instead of looking for jobs in jobs, I'm looking for the jobs in posts.  
Me: I. Try. To wind down. What I'm. Searching for. Most of the time. Instead of looking. For jobs. In jobs. I'm looking for. The jobs in. Post.  
Them: So sometimes fewer recruiters or few company owners, like startups or something, they just post the job, but they don't put it up on LinkedIn jobs. So what I'm doing now is searching for jobs as posts rather than jobs on LinkedIn jobs.  
Me: So sometimes. Few rec. Ruiters or few. Company owners like Start. Ups or something. They just force. The job, but they don't put. Stuff on LinkedIn job. S. So what I'm doing. Now is. Search. Ing for jobs. At post. Rather than. Jobs. On LinkedIn jobs. Interesting. Okay? Creative. Okay? Yeah. Anything that we haven't covered yet that you're doing to try to stand out in your search.  
Them: One day I posted. I mean, like, I don't know if you remember, but two weeks ago, we had. Two weeks, three weeks ago, we had this cloudflare outage, which was basically causing everything down.  
Me: One day. I. Posted. I mean, I don't know if. You remember? But two weeks ago. We had. So. We have. This clarif. Outage. Which was basically. Causing everything. Down.  
Them: And I posted that. And I had at least 5, 6 recruiters reach out to me after I posted that.  
Me: And. I posted. Something. I had at least. Five. Six sec groups. Reach out to me. After I posted. That.  
Them: Then I was like, okay, to get traction. Did it lead to anything? No. But is it a good way to get traction? Definitely.  
Me: Then. I was like, okay. Tract. Ion. Then if you lead to anything. More. But is it. A way to get. Faction. Definitely. Yeah. Gotcha. Okay? And. One of the I want to. Kind of pivot into kind of what? We're at least working on right now. We have this concept for an idea that could connect people, at least in a local sense. To build more meaningful connections. But we're looking at the idea maybe doing that without an interface or without an app, I should say, and instead leveraging existing messaging tools that people are already using. So I think what I'm curious about is what messaging tools you're either using on a daily basis or even have installed on your phone? Like, are you using WhatsApp or iMessage or SMS or Telegram? What other messaging systems are you on the front burner for? You.  
Them: Right. This is very similar to such communities like rtc. I don't know if, you know, rewriting the code. It's like this community for women. And they have these connects. That is one today in Buffalo itself, like in mainstream, they have one where they just put up the sports that we're calling all of you if you're in this area on slack.  
Me: This is. Very similar. To such. Communities. Like rtc. Admin. Rehabiting the. Code is like this. Community for women. And they have these. Connects. That is one. Today it works. Like main. Stream. They have one. Where? They just put. Up the sports that. Were calling all of you if. You have in this area. On black.  
Them: And they're like, come meet us here, or come, we'll meet at. They have this web app, and they're like, you go to the website, you see where is the connection? And then there's this black message where you're like, okay, I want to join. I don't want to join. You just go with it.  
Me: And. They're like, come. Readers here. They have. This web app and. They're like you go to. The website. You see? Where is the connection? And then there's the. Slack message. Where you're like, okay. I want to join. I don't want to join. You just go visit?  
Them: So has been useful for that because it maintains anonymity, which I really need and want.  
Me: For that because. Anonymity. Which I. Need. And want.  
Them: Which is great.  
Me: Which. Is great.  
Them: And when it comes to WhatsApp, I don't think I would want something professional to be put on WhatsApp because I think my WhatsApp is very personal, and I would keep it that way.  
Me: And when. It comes to WhatsApp. I don't think. I would want. Something professional. To be put on WhatsApp. Because I think my WhatsApp. Is very personal. And I'm keep it that way. Got you. Okay?  
Them: And when it comes to Instagram, I must say, all of them, I think that they're just too personal to be put into this area of life.  
Me: When. It comes to Instagram. I message? All of whom, I think. This is too personal. To be put into. This. Area of life.  
Them: When it comes to slack or when it comes to teams or something like that, it's different again.  
Me: When it comes to. Clap or when it comes to. Teams. Or something like that. It's different. Again.  
Them: You can just do that, Discord.  
Me: You can just. Discord.  
Them: When it is something like that, it's like you can maintain the normality, you can maintain everything while at the same time having a community the entire time to talk.  
Me: When it. Is something like that. It's like you can. Maintain the compet. Ing. While at the same time. Having a community. The entire time.  
Them: To not just like when it is happening or not.  
Me: Not just. Like when it is happen. Ing or not.  
Them: So I would say the slack for such matters.  
Me: So I. Would say. The search. Okay? That helps. And then. Let me just make sure I covered on my question. Sorry. I'm too focused on talking then to look at my questions and see. I covered everything I had to here. The last thing is like, no, that wouldn't apply. So never mind. I'm through all my questions. That's all I have for you, given that you were so kind to give me some of your time. If you have any questions for me, I don't know, just real quickly about me. I've. Been in software development for about 25 years. I spent most of the past 10 years at like the VP of product level for a bunch of health tech startups before losing my own job about a year and a half ago. And I went through the past year and a half also looking for work, and I spent about a year and a half applying to 1500 jobs. So you beat me really quick in a very short period of time. But, you know, my story got picked up by Business Insider, and it was a whole thing. And it led me to the opportunity that I have now, which is at a venture studio that's part of the 43 North foundation that is working on this specific problem. So that's at least my background really quickly for you. But I want to give you a chance to. If you had any questions for me, I'd be more than happy to answer them for you.  
Them: We do mind. Like if I could shoot your, would your mind looking over my resume and giving me any pointers that can help me?  
Me: We. Do mind. If I could. Do me. Would your mind looking. Over my resume. And giving me any point. Ers that can help me. Of course. Absolutely. I would be happy to do that.  
Them: Since you had, like, a vast experience and I barely even starting out, I think it.  
Me: Once. I've had a loss experience. And I. Barely even starting it. I think I've.  
Them: Would mean a lot for me to.  
Me: Seen a lot. Yeah, of course. That is absolutely something I could do for you. No problem at all.  
Them: Get some. I think it's just very messed up world, and it's a very messed up situation, but.  
Me: Situation.  
Them: I'll just get any help that I can at this point.  
Me: But. I. Can support. Perfect. Yeah, no problem. At all. Send it my way. You have my email address from the invite, so send it over and I'll be happy to look it over and give you any tips or advice.  
Them: Sure. And if you know of any roles or any per semes or any jobs at this point I am just hoping.  
Me: And. If you know by any. Body. At this. Point. I'm just open.  
Them: To any job.  
Me: To any.  
Them: That I get.  
Me: Job that I.  
Them: In any highway. So if you know and you come across any, please keep me in mind and let me know.  
Me: 'm willing myriad. If you know. To come across. Any. Please keep me in mind. Yeah. Once I see your resume and I get a feel for kind of what you're focused on, I'll be more than happy to connect you with anything that comes my way. I know that the opportunities out there are very slimmer now, but I'm hoping that maybe by the grace of God, we'll get some more traction on the job stuff after the first of the year. What? Everyone's budget's reset, so fingers crossed, right? Okay? Awesome. Well, thank you so much. Your time. It was great meeting you. Now I'm in your network, too, so feel free to reach out whenever you need something. And I'll let you know about your resume.  
Them: Thank you so much, Jake. Have a.  
Me: Thank you so much. You're welcome. Great talking to you. Thanks.  
Them: Talking. Say bye. Bye.
