Networking at school hasn't worked very well as the only internships I was able to land were software development jobs for my school. It feels like the only connections I have are to my school, and I don't plan to stay in Buffalo after graduating. It seems like I need to make more contacts outside of my school but I'm not sure where to start, and it all feels like too little too late as I'm a senior now"
