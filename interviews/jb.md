Me: Question I would have is like, what do you all see as needed? And things that. Are exceptionally hard to build, and we're unlikely. Or even when you all see as like the mvp. Yeah, because really, it's. Like. Getting approval for the MVP and just getting into the market. It's going to give us a lot of. Learning. Cycles. But we have to get there. What makes the cut in that space for you? And let's just figure out what that looks like from a talent. Selling standpoint to. Yeah, that would be helpful because I would say over the past couple of weeks, My biggest challenge was to narrow down the story to that v1. When I pitch people the grandiose version with all those Personas, There's too many cracks to point at, right? So I really had to clarify. And what I ultimately got to was this idea or the Persona of the program director. It's kind of a generic title. Let's call it. But this is someone like Hadar Aub. It's the folks who are running the groups at TechBuffalo. Those are the folks that need to essentially report on engagement. In order for funding to continue. As that frame. Accurate. Our sponsor is pretty, like, Ran is pretty focused on. You tell me. Who are a top 200. Talented people are. In. You tell me how many? We retained. I mean. That's like, it's very black and white for. Him for what he cares about. So from our angle, There's advantages. To. Reporting. But if they don't stack into something that can lead to. Learning. More about tal. Ent than what we previously did. It would be a hard. Sell. And so who wants the signal for the talent? What Persona is that? That's a good question. I mean, I think ultimately the signal for the talent would. Be a selling mechanism of tech Buffalo map to the employer community. To say when you need top. Talent. We have got a system that you can go to reliably. To find. That talent. Without. Posting the job, getting 1,000 resumes, trying to figure out who you should pull in or who's even. Real. Candidates. Pallid. They've got. Essentially. Like. An. Auditable. Track. Record of performance. That you can trust. Yeah. So in that vein, right, These are some of the things that maybe struggling with or where I hear the most questions. Is like you have this pool. Of talent. Right. And this could be people at ub. This can be people at mnt. This can be people at Tech Buffalo. Right. And so when I think about the broader talent community, Interacting with this platform. My question becomes, who is paying for this? What is the business model to get just people engaged in this community? Right. Cause we could apply the technology to this. But ultimately, where does the revenue come from? And I think that's maybe the disconnect that I have. Right now. Yeah, I think. For us. It's harder because. It's going to sound, like dumb from your perspective. It's like we're not exactly revenue first. Right. So. Where do I think that people. Would. Pay for a platform, I think it goes. In the core elements of what you've discussed. Although there's a women in tech lady you got to connect with. Because they developed. A national platform. That sounds SEM. I like yours. And they have had just. A shit. Time. Getting anybody. To even use it. And I want you. Just to meet with her. Figure out. That'd be great. Why? Because it's not me doubting this. It's just saying, like, there's got to be some valuable lessons in there. Absolutely. So I'll do that connection. I think that. I think. I don't know, like in the conversation with Mo. So I just go out, like only conversations. With people that I've had. And like. Validated. It's like, I think, on the M and T front and on the. Boat front. There is that idea that if we can. Leverage. Mentor. Ing as an asset to grow current companies. And spot talent that makes sense to us. Specifically of Mode. The idea was. Again. We have 100 plus interns. We don't know which one. S we're going to keep. If we can essentially crowdsource that a bit by having these engagements occur through the platform over time. So. Kind of monitoring. And tracking those collisions that would help give us signals about who some of these top candidates may be. That platform then also lets them keep those candidates warm as they're seeking to keep them while they're benched to be able to extend the offer when it becomes time. So M and T becomes the buyer in that Kennedy or. Mo. So, like, I think you can have an employer buyer. Do I think you can have a tech Buffalo type buyer. Sure. Like that. Yet you know. But, you know, the number of groups offer, like, wholesale types of internship experiences like we do. Is marginal. Within that space, though, like, you know, again. And I don't know. If the lady. Got back to you. From leadership. Buffalo, I believe if there's an email, yeah. That she responded to. But if she did, she might be good to talk to because I think, like, she's in that space of creating these collisions like that. And for her, as a view, to be more of like a. Mastermind group. Peer to peer group as opposed to, like, maybe individual. I think it'd be probably both. Like individual connections. But I can see her seeing the value in, like, the mast. Ermind tech group. So, like, anyway. I'm deferring to you all for like where the profit model. Ultimately lies. Like I haven't spent a bunch of energy. In that space. Where? Where I've looked at it is let me show you some of this stuff, too, as we, like, talk about it. I was just like, we need mentoring. This is going to solve mentoring issue. The mentoring component has. Value for the employer's rate. Within that framework, it feels possible to be able to collect some information. That could help to inform whether or not this particular. Talent is. Viable. Top tier. Yeah, right, Absolutely. Like, so even. Even to what you're saying here, right? There's. The. You know what, like the. The mentoring and mastermind. Essentially engaging folks in the community through those two vehicles. Right. That's kind of one area. And then there's this idea of, like, the resume is dead. There's that synthetic deadlock, right? And we need to allow people. To create something new and better than the resume to then apply. And I think again for V1, those are a little bit at odds. I think. Or like it's not focused enough. And I feel like it dilutes the story of maybe what we'd be be trying to do. So you look at these people. Like these people. Essentially create their groups. Of talent. And mentors. Yeah, right. And they pay for this group. And, you know, facilitation between all these folks. Right, kicks out the charts that we want to see. Right. And the measures that we're looking for. That's kind of what I see is like the. The simplest V1 into this. So. So let me just say, like, up front, like that, that I wasn't expecting anything. To be different. But. I would want to be simultaneously like if. If the one goes. And this proves as a mechanism to engage people. I would want that to unlock the analysis of the data that we're collecting on folks right now. But there's too many related to, like, all these different projects they have. And stuff like that, as well as, like, data that we could collect from this year's class of 2026 interns to say, okay. What's available and they're willing to give us. How could that spin up to run alongside this? To be able to ultimately unlock as the third buyer in that wing. You know, essentially like the, the hrc, these groups. And again, like, maybe by default, they're in there. But, you know, when I think about the HR departments, I don't think about. I'm not talking about an ats. I'm talking about the ability. To. Get into a system and see. A different way of looking at Tal. Ent. And I think there's a lot of education that goes along with that. Very much so. But I think that's the advantage, having to type off of those to figure out, like, how much education does it take to get somebody to a tipping point? And get them in here saying, you know, What I can see that, like, this person in that group, and they've done this, and they've done that. This is how, you know. They've shown up over time. Does that give me better insight than what I'm seeing today? And, like, collect that feedback to figure out, then what is this, like, agent that sits. Kind of in the wings for this group. What does it need to be capable of to return value? I don't know the answer to that, but I know that. Like if that first phase. Proves to be something that people will pick up. Then the data is going to be present to pull in the HR to say, and how does this become valuable to you? I don't know that we know the. Answer to that question. I think we. Have a I think there's some reason why hypothesis that other things that we compose but. Yeah, I wouldn't be. Let's double click on that because I think you're right. You know, I feel that directionally, all combining. Where I. Where I think about what's happening. Within these two, really, they're. They're trying to get people colliding. Right. In order to basically see that, you know, for an employer, it's going to be better retention. Right kind of upskilling. Through peer to peer stuff. And like this. Is, I believe, what the program director and the employer want. When we come here. Right? We get into, like, they actually want to hire. Talent. Right. They want to identify them. Right. Right where no others can. Right. They have the tool on the insights. But I think it's like, it's this divide that I'm starting to feel. Whereas, like, this is very clear to me. This is even what I would say partially validated through. Mentor deck. And what we're doing there. Whereas, like, this is a different need from the technology. Now, I think what we're saying here. Is that if people are colliding and doing all the right things, participating with, you know, mentors and mastermind groups, That the signals that come out. This group would be willing to pay for. Is that the right story? So. So they would be willing to pay for that. Along with some additional information about the candidate. The candidate, when they click that button, would have to be willing to either supply or be prompted to supply by an agent. Right? So if I'm in this system and I say, you know what? I want to put all of this good work that I've done, On the market. When I click to put it on the market, I need something to tell me how to make myself marketable. So I think, like, there's. Yes, there's the HR bucket. That's buyer. I also think that there is potentially like the university and the student as a buyer. I'm not saying that you position the student as a buyer up front. But what I am saying is that. There's a system right now where, again, the pain of 200 applications going in and not hearing. Anything back. The ability. To. Have a system that can give prompts to that student about what they can do to improve their employability. That functions within this real world marketplace of, like, talent development, where you can get engaged in these opportunities that actually exist to grow your skills and ability outside of just. I'm in this class, I have this GPA because that, that's what the reality is right now. Right. This offers that student a whole different opportunity. To engage and differentiate. I think that's extraordinarily valuable. To the student. And I think that in an era of increased accountability that is on. The horizon. For at least what everyone seems to be forecasting for universities. Isn't that kind of the exact mechanism at universities need is to say, like, this is how what we do translates into real work skills. That's why the Dark Horse. For me, all of this is like. This actually becomes part of what gets embedded into those three and 400 level courses where it's more project based and not as much. Of. Not as much like the. Book answers. Because it's like this mechanism is the one that would actually showcase alignment. Industry. Highlight the relevance of the skills that students are learning. Allow for the feedback loops that are necessary to improve your curriculum. Like you could kind of go on and on again, hypothetical with a dark horse, but. I think that there is an element of this that when it's unlocked, It's just going to feel a shitload better than going into handshake. Certainly you might go into handshake still to apply as a mechanism. But if you want to know. How do I compare? Tal. Ent that's out there. What are the things that are going to differentiate me? Do I have those? I think this system over time. Could actually do that. Yeah, I'm with you. And I think you know what you're starting to hint at is really the profile record. Correct. Now, in the initial version, Just what I had in my head now. It's facilitated through these agent combos. SMS voice calls. Does the session tracking has reporting dashboard. And basically as the talent engages with the agent, it automatically builds their profile and record. And I think what I'm hearing you say is you also want the student to upload. Somehow give information about their projects. And then put it back into their record. Yeah. So there's interesting studies that are validated from around the world that you have a couple. Nuances in it, right? Like, one of them is that if a student uploads their transcript, And you see a full record, like, they're great. Like those courses align to particular skills being stronger or weaker, and you can actually profile. I think the other part of it is there are like the GitHub repositories and other places that. Can showcase some of what the candidate has done. And then I think, like, the third element of that is that, like, if the agent is in doubt as to whether or not I can skill for a job that they have targeted as, like, their ideal job, It can issue them a test. Say, validate your skill. Like skill validation needed. Yes. And it can do that. I view all of those. Every single community we just talked about. Is only worth developing. The first layer of the experiment works. Right. Do employers. And students. And employers? Do professionals with professionals connect? Do students connect to professionals and students connect? If that world starts to emerge from this, then I think you doubled down on these profiles of records. You're going to be extraordinarily valuable. And there has to be a way to allow people to turn this into a talent engine that they own. Right? Because now I get transparency. If I. Don't like if I'm the candidate and I don't quite fit the mix for something. I can be given feedback and I can be empowered with agency. Let me just text one person. I'm running. Just a couple minutes. Later. It's helpful to hear you stage that out. Because that's ultimately what I respond with when I get questions from the team. Like, if we can get the people, like, this is most important. And then once we can prove the humans will engage with agents and each other, then we can start layering on and saying, do you want to extend your record, your profile with these things that verify. And I think what you and the team should vet this against. Is that the right order? I don't know, but that's an order that I need. Right. Meaning I need employers to be able to get in and engage with my Power Up Tech students. At least, like from. My perspective as it stands. The engagement and light profile building would be V1. Yeah. So, like text to join. You're in sms, a few questions. Agent is going to call you and interview you in a really light way and that automatically builds your profile. And now you're in the circle to be introduced to mentors and mastermind groups. I would just add really, really want to double down on. How do we get. LinkedIn integr. Ation. Because LinkedIn integr. Ation. Is. Like it's a killer feature for me. Because of the ability to stay. Continually up to date with our alumni. Over time. I know an agent can call them over time and do that. But I do get locked in. And they can get permissions up front. Like that is a killer feature. For me. Because it does a lot of our homework. Because we have to know where these people have gone and track their stats over time. And so you can imagine how hard that is. 500 mentors or 500 alumni who have not. Stayed in contact with us, we have to literally hunt. Them down. Yes. So just from I know side feature may be hospital may not be possible. We can talk to LinkedIn, we figure that out. But I'm fine with the other one. I think the only, like, the devil's advocate that I'm playing is, like, I think you. Have. You're either. You're either starting with a tezzy like system and you're saying it just needs to exist for pre career town. Right. Like that is one viable option. Is to say, Tezzy, you know. Is. Worth, you know, has had x million dollars of investment. It's doing this work, but it's not doing it in a way that was really conducive to showcasing pre career talent. And you're betting that there's a pre career talent? That's there that needs to understand how to separate the signal from the noise when it comes to just having a gpa. And kind of. A university pedigree. I think there's a market there. I think. This market that people probably don't know, don't have the full vision of why it's so necessary. Yet. That. Can be tested and. Built. So I think those two, technically, both of those options exist. I think that from a tech Buffalo standpoint, We need to launch mentoring this. Summer. Right. I need to pay for something. That's going to launch mentoring. I'm totally fine paying for us to figure out if this thing works. Then buying somebody else's 25 or $30,000 program. And if it works, Then. We also still need to stay true to our mission and putting a talent engine behind it. So. That's my angle on this. If the board would ask me, I would say you're going to invest in this one anyway. So sure we can test A or B first. Right. If we test b first. We're just taking costs that we would already incur, putting them into a platform that we can develop, and that way. If this thing works. We've got the foundation to add the other element and all of the data, which is what we're going to need to be able to really make sure that this thing works and much more unique data. Yeah. I'm with you. Generally, you feel good about. Again, Stage one being. Get these people in groups colliding through mentorship and mastermind. Yes. And then from there all these things align is like stage two path. Once we prove that we can get change human behavior. Essentially. And I think you would get, I think. Your marketplace there. It's your program director, it's your employer. I still think it's your university. Because if you get this up and running, you're going to get individual college departments paying to have access exactly for their students into this system. Yeah, I kind of bucket them under that program director. But, yeah, I totally agree, because Hadar is saying this stuff. Everybody that you introduced me to, Nick, is saying all the same things. And, you know, if they really hire four, It's a grit and follow through and all these soft skills that are not portrayed in resumes or even projects. So that's where the agentic forces really highlight that. Yeah, and that's just why I like. Very biased. And there has to be a talent engine. At the back of this. But. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And I do, I believe the path is there. It's simply like priority clarity for. Especially if there's tech Buffalo investment in this. Right. It's like you would have my very clear talking points aligned with it that would say. You know? Regardless of where we need to build this full engine. We might as well start by making sure that people are going to connect with each other in a way that's going to give us very unique data. Because we have to get that done this summer anyway because we've already promised to our employer partners mentoring. And mentoring was something that this board, the 4300 foundation board, Charged us with figuring out by the time we got to power up tech 2026. So we need to get to work with. Essentially radial agency or radio, whatever. Sure. And, you know, we should slot this as a 50k investment. Sure. It might be. It might be 15k more than what we would otherwise spend. But I think that 15k is a hedge that we can actually build a system that's better than those that are on the market right now. To create this engagement. And then we own the data and what the data we built system to. I think that's right. 50. K is enough money. For you guys. But, like, probably not. It's going to be hard to even do it with 100, I think. Here's the thing. What I've told Sarah is like, phase it out. Let's get some proof points. I think to us get something built for 50k, if that's what we can allocate up front. Then let's meet with employers before it goes live and saves us on the right track. And get some validation. We're going to have the Tech Advisory Council in play. So you can have a whole group of CISOs and CTOs and CIOs that you can come present to and talk to and get validation that this is on the right track, or this is what I'd like to see. My hope would be. If they're aligned. It should be enough. To unlock another 50. K. I mean. We got 250k. Bucketed in this to try to get us to the point that it can become. A radio company. Because we already. Talked about Eric's. Eric built company. There. All the companies. 250k is not going to build. Us anything. We have to get this R250. Is there to take a bet on something that we believe can get into the Venture Studio and be adopted? Put a little bit more. Power. Behind it. Great. This is what we want to bet on. Yeah, it's very aligned. I will say. Across all initiatives. So I like this. This is very helpful. I think it very much so aligns to kind of the stage gates that I'm envisioning. That are clear, buildable and really tackling our hardest assumptions first. What would be most helpful to me. So that I can. Be. Able to defend this using language that we agree on. For you to tell me. Like, what's phase one and phase two? That gets us. Like, what's the phase one that occurs? In the column and board. Meeting. And. Then when does the phase two have to kick in? To get us to an. M.v.p. by the summer. And. What are the features associated. With that. And I will. Speak passionately. I will let them know. Exactly where I stand with. And I'll let them know that I think that. We. Found a bunch of shitty companies. That are out there. Right now. They get low. Traction. Built some of them. Actually, that has. The director of Odoo as well as the talent team at Mode. Excited that somebody could really serve the marketplace in a very unique way. That's right. So I can be pushing back to the guys. In a respectful way to say you're truthful. I think this is great. Bet, actually. Yeah, I just want to make sure I have your talking points. I don't create. If I say something. Next time it rolls into. The queue for adventures feels misaligned. Cause some issues. I just want to, if you would. Have enough. Definitely bullet points to get me through. The barrage of questioning that will come. Because I haven't feel with Raha because he's going to push back on. Okay? Yeah. Okay, I'll put that together. I've already started, but I think having that map will be very clarifying. I think it very easily defend. Program director, employer track. I mean, it's got. Like you said, it's going to involve people in universities. And one of our early signals. Can be. We launched it with Matt. Heck, we can get, like, if you get an mvp. That is just. Like a really basic. Element. We can. Watch it on attack. Me raise. Signed up for it. We can do special features. Implement. Ed tech that incentivizes. Shit. Do three meetups and get. Your copy of X or whatever. Stupid shit just to build. Momentum towards those. Connections. But that's 3:27. Is women in tech. So that is a potential test point if you want to get something out there really early in the market. That's the most mvp of mvps. That would be the opportunity. Because we can integrate it into our confidence. People need to make training the conference, right? Exactly. Wants to connect with each other. Our next point of really testing it is going to be the full summer, right? So you got a full summer of testing that is unprecedented for other groups to have. It's going to have 200 mentors or 200. Interns. 100 employers all connected into a system, leveraging it and giving feedback. What else do you want? That's right. This is what we're going. Yeah. So I think this would be my argument. It's like, why the hell are we somebody else? I couldn't agree more. Yeah. Okay, good. I got a Ford 15. I know you said you had to run to, but this is helpful. Super clarifying. I have my next step, so I'll put that together and I'll share that around with you. Overall. At the end of the day, I inherently trust. Collective. Team. Yeah, I think it's just about. Again, this clarifies the story because I was really broad. Here's all the people we're going to affect and we'll get there. But now we're really getting down to brass tax and staging it out. Yeah. I think we want to create a network that your employees love. And over time, we want to bring your employees in to partner with your talent team to give signals to where the best talent may lie is they can the people in the. Ecosystem. That's right. Your employees win. You win. People that are trying to get jobs that are best in the world win. Right. Buffalo wins. Fully. Cool. Thank you. I appreciate it.
