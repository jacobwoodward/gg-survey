Me: Hi, jonathan.  
Them: Hi. How are you? Can you hear me?  
Me: Hi. How are you? Can you hear me, Jake? I can. I can. Thanks so much for joining me for a quick session here. I really appreciate it. As you can imagine, when I sent out a message like that, the response rate's pretty low. So I'm very highly appreciative of the response and the willingness to chat with you for a few minutes today. I really appreciate it.  
Them: Jake. Not a problem. Not a problem. It's late in the day at work. It's getting towards the Christmas season.  
Me: Not a problem. Not a problem. It's late in the day at work towards Christmas season. Yeah, yeah, every time.  
Them: Nothing but time. It seems like something interesting. I mean, I've been working for a while now, but I spent a long time out of work and.  
Me: It seems like something interesting. I mean, I've been working for a while now, but I spent a long time out of work. And.  
Them: I think I have sat for years continuing to do post mortem.  
Me: I. Think I. 've sat for years continuing to do post mortem.  
Them: On. Why the failure to relaunch and all the things.  
Me: On. Why? The failure to relaunch. And all the things. Yeah, exactly. After going through about a year and a half off myself, I happened to land with Adventure Studio, who's working on this project that obviously is very close to my heart. So we're in the idea stage right now. We don't have anything built. We're not live, but we're trying. To solve it. And we're trying to have as many real conversations with people and not just relying on what AI tells us. So just trying to hear it from people who've been through it and are struggling. Not actively, strongly necessarily, but I think that everyone has different opinions on what's broken about the system. That's kind of where most of my questions are going to go today, but I think would be a great way to start. Is just to maybe get a little bit of like an elevator pitch from you about where you are in your career journey. You already said you're back working again, but what did that process look like when you're out of work, and how did you find it and what did you struggle with? I think that would be just a great start. We can go from there.  
Them: Well, I mean, I was fortunate to. I was fortunate to run into an old friend of mine who was my deskmate. We were both fixed income traders for a local hedge fund. For we sat next to each other for probably a dozen years or so. He left. Kind of needed to get out of the business like the hedge fund business is notorious for grinding people up. He had just got married. I think they were thinking about having kids.  
Me: Well, I mean, I was fortunate to. I was fortunate to run into an old friend of mine who was my destate. We were both fixed income traders. For a local. Hedge fund. For. We sat next to each other for probably a dozen years or so. He? Left. Kind of needed to get out of the business. Like the hedge fund business is notorious for grounding people up. He had just got married. I think. They were thinking about having kids.  
Them: And I think he thought it was time in his life to make a pivot.  
Me: And I think he thought. It was time in his life to make a pivot.  
Them: Wisely, I will say.  
Me: Wise. Ly I will say.  
Them: He took that time and founded the business that I'm now working with him on. He started building homes, discovered he was really good at it, really liked it.  
Me: He? Took that time. And. Founded. The business. That. I'm now working with him. On. He started building homes. Discovered he. Was really good at it. Really liked it.

Me: And. Be in denial about what was. Going on with the. Firm. We were losing. Aum things were. Going well. But.  
Them: But you're making 3, 4, $500,000 a year. It's easy to ignore all the telltale signs and be like, no, everything's fine.  
Me: You're making. 3, 4, 500,000. Dollars a year. It's easy to ignore all the tell. Tale signs and be like, Everything's fine.  
Them: But I did that. Meanwhile, a few things in my health kind of failed.  
Me: But. I did that meanwhile. A few things in my health kind of failed. I.  
Them: I blew my knee up in telluride skiing in 19, which led to a lot of rehab, as you might imagine. In that rehab, they discovered something was going wrong with my heart.  
Me: Blew my knee. Up and telluride skiing in 19. Which. Led to a lot. Of rehab as you might. Imagine. In that rehab. They discovered. Something was going wrong. With my heart.

Me: But. It was such.  
Them: A. I guess it made me think about what I was doing. What I was doing it.  
Me: A I guess. It made. Me think about what I was doing. Why I was. Doing it.  
Them: And the way I was sort of treated while I was in the middle. I missed six weeks of work for that.  
Me: And the way. I was sort of treated. While. I was in the middle. I missed six weeks of work. For that.

Me: I. Thought it was time, probably. To move on. Why do my friends were moving on. A lot of them were. Taking deals and moving on. And. Finally I had it. One day. Towards the end of summer.  
Them: I got something from my boss at the time telling me that they were taking off the entire summer, basically, and it was all going to fall on me. And I was like, no, I don't think so.  
Me: I got. Something from my boss. At the time. Telling me. That they were taking. Off the entire. Summer. Basically, it was all going to fall on. Me, and I was like, no. I don't think so.

Me: So. I. Left all my own. Accord. Thinking that I was going to. Take a break. That break being?  
Them: That break being? Like, I don't know anywhere. Nine to 18 months. Whatever it took to kind of reconnect with my kids. Because it's like a long hours spent working in a job like that. And my kids were getting older. I had one in college now.  
Me: Like, I don't know. Anywhere. Nine to 18 months. Whatever it took to kind of reconnect with my kids. Because it was a lot of long hours. Spent working. In a job like that. And. My kids were getting. Older. I had one in college. Now.

I didn't really know about that, honestly, until a lot of these connotations, until people started. Telling me.

Them: We need to do what we can do to make this business work, because this is the best way for us to all move forward.  
Me: We need to. Do what we can do to make. This business work. Because this is the best way for us. To employ.  
Them: But it's fun from that perspective. There's a lot to do. There's still a lot more to do.  
Me: It's fun from that. There's a lot to do. There's still a lot more to do.  
Them: But we kind of have everyone rowing the boat in the same direction, which is always key. And I work with people I consider to be great friends.  
Me: We. Kind of have everyone. Rowing the boat in the same direction. Which is always key. And I. Work with. People I concern to be great friends.  
Them: Which is great.  
Me: Which. Is great.  
Them: Especially inside of a hedge fund, there's a lot of people who you don't like that don't like you.  
Me: Especially. Inside of. A hedge fund. There's a lot of people. You don't like. Don't like. You. I can imagine. Yeah, it's an interesting trajectory that you kind of. I mean, it's a great story to go from that job that you were successful at but fell out of love with and worked yourself to the bone, got disheartened with being a member of corporate America. Then when you had to go kind of like, refine something in that same mold, You hit these walls that have existed for a lot of other job seekers until deciding that your best bet was to kind of bet on yourself, even if it is in a completely brand new industry, still using the things you've been good at throughout your career and using that in a way to be part of your own thing. So I think there's a really great story arc there for you. If you don't mind me asking, I'm curious about that time that you were kind of looking for something. Do you have any rough numbers about how long that lasted and how many jobs? And what the kind of response rate kind of thing was off the top of your head.  
Them: I would say initially out of the gate, there was this. See, I left in April of 2021 from Carlson Capital, where I was employed.  
Me: I would say initially out of the gate, there was. See, I left in april of. 2021from Carlson Capital, where I was employed.  
Them: And I worked briefly for a private lender called residential capital from St. January and April 2022.  
Me: And. I worked briefly for a private. Lender called. Residential capital. From, say, january to april. 2,022.  
Them: That was a securitization.  
Me: That was. A securitization.  
Them: Platform they were trying to develop.  
Me: Platform. They were trying. To develop.  
Them: For. Rental mortgages, people who were investing in rental residential rental properties.  
Me: Rental. Mortgages, people who were. Investing in. Rental, residential rent. Al properties. Okay?  
Them: So SFR is what they call it. Single Family Rental Market. We wanted to write mortgage paper and sell it to banks and aggregators.  
Me: So sfr. Is what they call a single family rental market. We wanted to. Write mortgage paper. And. Sell it. To bank. S and aggreg. Ators.  
Them: However, if you will remember what happened to the housing market around the end of February, early March that year, rates bumped a little over 200bps and changed the whole game for everyone.  
Me: However. You will remember. What happened to the. Housing market. Around the end of February. Early march. That year. Rate. S bumped a little over. 200 bps. And changed the whole. Game for everyone.  
Them: Especially on the aggregator side, because what was yield and traded over par was now underwater, and it just no longer made sense.  
Me: Especially. On the aggreg. Ator side because what was yield and traded over bar. Was now under. Water. And it just. No. Longer made sense.  
Them: So, again, it was kind of a dual whammy thing. Like, I found out that I had a tumor on my left kidney, and I think they were trying to find a way to tell me that, hey, this isn't going to work.  
Me: So again. It was kind of a dual wham. My thing. I found out. That I had a. Tumor on my left kidney. And. I think they were trying to find. A way to tell me. That. Hey, this isn't. Going to work.  
Them: We're not sure what to do with you at this point.  
Me: We're not. Sure what to do. With you. At this point.  
Them: So I went to them and said, look.  
Me: So. I went to them. And said, Look.  
Them: This is not great. I need to go take care of this. It was an operation to fix it, but it cost me a couple of months.  
Me: This is not great. I need to go. Take care of this. It was. An operation to fix. It. But. It. Cost me a couple of months.  
Them: So it wasn't everyone's best interest to split. Plus some of the activity. Like, I didn't really know a lot about this private lender until I got on the inside.  
Me: It wasn't everyone's. Best interest to split. Plus some of the activity, like, I didn't really know. A lot about. This. Private lender until I got. On the inside.  
Them: And some of the things that they do, I mean.  
Me: Some of the things that they do.  
Them: I worked for a hedge fund. I'm not like a. I'm not trying to teach anyone about morals and ethics here.  
Me: I. Worked for a hedge fund. I'm not. Trying to. Teach anyone about. Morals. And ethics. Here.  
Them: But, I mean, everything we always did was on the up and up. But every now and again, you know, there may be someone across the desk that gets screwed or loses a bunch of money. I mean, that's just how this goes.  
Me: But. Everything we always. Did was on the up and up. But every now and again. There may be someone across the. Desk that gets screwed or loses a bunch of money. I mean, that's just how this goes.  
Them: But some of the things they were involved with, they had a payday lending platform in Puerto Rico. They did all of these fix the flip loans.  
Me: But. Some of the things they were involved with. They had a payday. Lending platform. In puerto rico. They did. All of these fix. And flip loans.  
Them: Charging people who couldn't get credit elsewhere, like 20%, and then if they defaulted on it, it were late on a payment.  
Me: Charging people. Who couldn't get credit. Elsewhere. Like 20%. And then if they defaul. Ted on in it or. Late on a payment.  
Them: They had it in the contract that they could or close on the property.  
Me: They. Had it in the contract. That. They could foreclose. On the property.  
Them: There was a lot of things there. It was a little beyond, like, what I thought it was.  
Me: There was a lot of things. There. It's a little beyond. What I. Thought it was.  
Them: And I had my suspicions, but it was good to get away from that. I didn't feel like that was going to be.  
Me: And. I had my suspicions. But. It was good. To get away from that. I didn't feel like. That was going to be.  
Them: I would have liked to. Probably stuck around a few more months and gotten a few more paychecks, but it just didn't feel like that was going to be the right way to do it.  
Me: I. Would have liked to probably. Stuck around a few more months. And gotten a few. More paychecks. But. It just didn't feel like that was. Going to be the right. Way to do it.  
Them: That period, though, like between when I quit, in between when I got this job, it felt like there were a lot, a lot of people.  
Me: That. Period, though. Between when I quit. And between when I got. This job, it felt like. There. Were a lot of people.

Me: On my own. And I was talking to.  
Them: Managers and local hedge funds.  
Me: Managers. And local hedge fund. S.  
Them: Like Canyon Capital had moved here from Los Angeles. I talked to them about trader position. They ended up filling it from within. Someone a lot younger than me.  
Me: Like. Canon Capital had moved. Here from los angeles. It's hard because. I'm going to trader position. They ended. Up filling. It from within. Someone. A lot younger than me.  
Them: Which was fine. I was asking for a lot of money. It's like, if I'm going to do this job again, especially for somebody this big, I'm going to get paid or I'm not going to do it.  
Me: Which was. Fine. I was asking for a lot. Of money. It's like, if I'm going to do this, Job again. Especially for somebody. This big. I'm going to get paid. Or I'm not going to do it. Right.  
Them: Barrow Hanley, like some of the others and.  
Me: Barrow. Henley some of the. Others and.

Them: Maybe my resume is wrong. Maybe my approach to this is all wrong.  
Me: Maybe. My resumes are wrong. Maybe my approach to. This is all wrong.  
Them: And I would say for the five, six thousand dollars I spent on that, I felt like I got very little in return.  
Me: And. I would say. For the five. $6,000. I. Spent on that. I felt like. I got very. Little in return.  
Them: Honestly, because I think it was a lot of the things that I was already doing, it really didn't provide me with.  
Me: Honestly. Because I think it was a lot of the things. I was already. Doing? It really didn't provide. Me with any.  
Them: Any earth shattering news or anything.  
Me: Earth. Shattering news. Or anything.  
Them: I've always known how to talk to people, like sit down and have a conversation with anyone. I'm not afraid to Networking it may have helped me sit down and think a little bit more holistically about who was truly in my expanded network and people that I could reach out to and try to.  
Me: I've always. Known how. To talk to people. Like, sit down and have. A conversation with any. One not afraid to. Network. Ing it may. Have helped me. Sit down and. Think a little bit. More holistically. About? Who? Was truly in my expanded network and people that I could reach out to. And. Try to.  
Them: At least ask questions and get conversations started in some direction.  
Me: At least. Ask questions. And get convers. Ations started. In some direction.  
Them: So it probably broadened my network. For me, that was probably the most important thing that came out of that. The tech skills class was just. It was kind of fun. I learned a few things. I mean, obviously now with the advent of AI I don't know that it's worth much.  
Me: So. It probably broadened. My network for me. That was probably the most important. Thing that came out. Of that. The. Tech skills class. It was kind of. Fun. I learned a few things. I mean. Obviously. Now with the. Advent of AI. I don't know that it's. Worth much.  
Them: But I think, you know, it was never about writing code anyway. It was like, look.  
Me: But. I think. It was never about. Writing code anyway. It was like, look.  
Them: Code has already been written for almost everything out there. It's your job to go out on the Internet and find it, and then you have to know how to connect it and make it work together.  
Me: Code. Has already been written for almost. Everything out there. It's your job to go out on the Internet. And find it. And then you have to know how to. Connect it. And make it work together.  
Them: And that's essentially what AI does for us now. But it's not perfect, but.  
Me: And that's essentially what AI. Does for us. Now. But it's not perfect. But.  
Them: I think having an internal understanding and be able to look and see syntax and flow, I think that that's helpful.  
Me: I think having an internal. Understanding and being able to. Look and see. Syntax. And flow. I think. That's helpful.  
Them: On some level. I don't really use it in my current job, but it's great to know. I feel like I've at least got a little bit smarter.  
Me: On some level. I don't really use it. In my current job. But it's. Great to know. I feel like. I'm at least. Done a little bit smarter.  
Them: From doing that.  
Me: I'm doing. That. I'm curious about the networking piece of that you mentioned that you were able to kind of get some support there to improve the way you network. Would you say that most of that networking was done over LinkedIn or was that numbers you had in your phone like the old fashioned way? What mechanisms were you using to do that networking.  
Them: Numbers and emails that I had from my former life. I took my entire contact list ago. I developed and I downloaded it into an RTF file.  
Me: Numbers and emails that I had from my former life. I took my entire contract list. The guy developed and I downloaded. It into an rtf. File.  
Them: Before I left and sent it to my personal address, so I always had that.  
Me: Before. I left. And. Sent it to my personal address. So I. Always had that.  
Them: That was helpful, but it broadened my reach.  
Me: That. Was helpful. But it broadened my reach.  
Them: Too, because I felt like at that point, even though, I mean, my wife is from here, her parents live, like, very close to us here in Dallas. Dallas has always been heralded as one of the great white collar job markets. It was still being heralded as that when I was finding nothing.  
Me: Too. Because I felt like. At that point. Even though. My. Wife is from here. Her parents live. Very close to us. Here in dallas. Dallas. Has always been. Heralded as. One of. The great white collar. Job markets. It was still. Being. Herald. Ed as that. When I was. Finding nothing.  
Them: And so I started actually talking to people, would reach out from New York, Chicago.  
Me: And so. I started, actually. Talking. To people. Would reach. Out from new york. Chicago.  
Them: New Hampshire, Minneapolis, like Kansas City. There's all these different places. Benville, Arkansas. People were reaching out. It just. I was like,  
Me: New. Hampshire. Minneapolis. Like. Kansas city. There's all. These different places. Bentonville, ar. Kansas. People were reaching out. I was. Like.  
Them: Because I had a kid who was junior senior here and another one that was freshman sophomore. I didn't want to uproot my kids. My wife has a real estate practice here. Like, she's been a realtor here for years in East Dallas. You can't just move somewhere and recreate what you've been able to put together through that because a lot of what when you've been doing it this long for her, as long as it's repeat business or their kids or their parents,  
Me: Because I had a kid. Who was junior senior here? And another one. Who saw freshman. Sophomore. I didn't want to uproot. My kids. My. Wife. Has. A real estate. Practice. Here. She's been a realtor here. For years. In east dallas. You can't just move. Somewhere. And recreate. What? You've been able to. Put together. Through that. Because. When you've been. Doing it this long. For her, whether it's repeat business. Or. Their kids or their parents.  
Them: Are different like that, that networking is so key there.  
Me: Are. Different. Like that network. Ing is so key there.  
Them: But it was that internal fight about, like, how much money is enough to get us to move? And it just never got far enough along, like, to go someplace, I don't know, like Minneapolis or Magerson, Wisconsin, for the Wisconsin Teachers Retirement Fund or whatever. It's just. I was like, look.  
Me: Was. That internal fight. About how much money? Is enough to get us. To move. And. It just never got far enough. Along. To go some. Place. Or know, like Minneapolis. Or madison. Wisconsin. For the wisconsin. Teachers retirement fund or whatever. I just. I was like, look.  
Them: If we're going to pick up and we're going to do all of this and leave all of our friends and everything behind.  
Me: If. We're going to pick up and. We're going to do all. Of this. And leave all of our. Friends and everything behind.  
Them: It's got to be worth a while. And it just.  
Me: It's. Got to be worthwhile. And.  
Them: Kind of never was, but, you know, obviously.  
Me: It kind of. Never was. But. There's also that, the fear of the security, too. I don't know about you, I don't want to put words in your mouth or lead the witness here, but it's like the loyalty that used to exist in corporate America, even if there was any, right? It's like almost gone there's no such thing as loyalty at a corporation anymore. So it's like you pick up and move your family, and like, six months later, they're like, oh, we restructured. Sorry. That's exactly it. And people were telling me, you need to be really careful if you pick up and move.  
Them: That's exactly it. And people were telling me, like, you need to be really careful if you pick up and move. You might want to just go there and do the job for a while. Because usually if you're the last one hired, you could be the first one out.  
Me: You might want to just go there and do the job for a while. Because usually if you're the last one hired, you could be the first one out if they decide to go in the other direction.  
Them: If they decide to go in the other direction. And I was highly cognizant of that. I saw people in that first iteration of me looking for a job. When those people started reaching out to me in a reverse contact.  
Me: And I was highly cognizant of that. I saw people in that first iteration of me looking for a job. When those people started reaching out to me in a reverse contract.  
Them: Saying, hey, I found myself out of work.  
Me: Saying, hey. I found myself out of work.  
Them: Do you think you can help me out? And I'm like,  
Me: Do you think you can help me out? I'm like,  
Them: No, I'm still here doing the same thing. I don't know that I can help you, but.  
Me: No. I'm still here doing. The same thing. And I don't know. That I can help you.  
Them: Maybe we can work together.  
Me: But. Maybe we can work together.  
Them: Use, like, cross contacts or something like that, but.  
Me: Use. Cross contacts or something like that. But.  
Them: For, I would say for every one person that you would see out there in your contacts, in your network, like, even on, I mean, LinkedIn. I hate that LinkedIn, the way that.  
Me: I would say for. Every one person that. You would see out there. In your contacts. And your network even. On. I mean, LinkedIn. I hate LinkedIn. The way that.  
Them: It? I don't know. I feel like.  
Me: I don't know. I feel like.  
Them: Most of what I see on LinkedIn is what I don't want to see.  
Me: Most. Of what I see on linked. In is what I don't. Want to see. Yeah, I think there's two. I think there's three unique job, three unique products inside of LinkedIn that are all separate from each other. The first of which being like the job board, which is often its own. Then you have the chat tool. Which allows you to just message people and search for people and find for people. Then you have your feed. And I think the feed is a bunch of AI garbage and a bunch of performative nonsense. Whereas the real value of it to me is the ability to find people that match certain criteria and make connections. But even that is a little bit ineffective because it's like a black hole.  
Them: Absolutely.  
Me: Right. People have stopped looking at it because it's so much garbage. It's just Internet slop, basically, is where it's turned into.  
Them: It is. People have stopped looking at it because it's so much garbage. It's just Internet slop, basically, is what it's turned into. It's not that useful of a tool for getting.  
Me: It's not that useful of a tool for. Getting if you could get their contact information from that.  
Them: If you can get their contact information from that and go outside of it, that's kind of the best thing at this point, I would say.  
Me: And go outside of it. That's kind of the best thing. At this point. I would say.  
Them: I don't know that it was for a lack of, like, people like, you want to blame everybody in your network that doesn't, like, respond and offer to help, but it's like.  
Me: I don't know that. It was for a lack of. People. You. Want to blame everybody. In your network. That. Doesn't respond and offer. To help. But. It's like.  
Them: When I was working my job, how many times was I just apt to, like, pick up everybody who reached out? Hey, man, can you help me out? It's like, no. Probably wasn't it?  
Me: When I. Was working. My job. How many times? Was. I just apt to pick up everybody? Who reached out. Hey, man, can you help me out? Prob. Ably wasn't. It.  
Them: Makes you a lot more cognizant of.  
Me: Makes you a lot more cogn. Izant.  
Them: You know, actually hearing people out when they have something to say.  
Me: Actually. Hearing people out. And we have something to say.  
Them: And I don't know if it's. It's not really a feeling of regret or whatever. I know I didn't do everything just right throughout this process because I was learning to do this all over again.  
Me: And I don't. Know if. It's not really a feeling. Of regret. Or whatever. I know I didn't do. Everything just right. Throughout this. Process because I was learning. To do this. All over again. Sure.  
Them: You know what I'm saying?  
Me: You know what I'm saying?  
Them: But it was a different level. The last time I had done it, I was like a mid tier or like a 20 something employee.  
Me: But. It was a different level. The last time I had. Done it. I was like, A mid tier or like a 20 something employee.  
Them: And here I was in my 40s, like a director MD level, looking for a high salary and a good title, and. And it's just.  
Me: And here I was a 40s. Like a director. Md level. Looking. For a high, sal. Ary. And a good title. And. It's just.  
Them: Horrifically different.  
Me: Horrifically different.  
Them: Like, the. The criteria is pretty crazy. The interviews are really crazy.  
Me: The criter. Ia. Is. Pretty crazy. The interviews. Are really crazy.  
Them: And when I say really crazy, like some of the things that people have the audacity to actually ask you, I mean, it's. If a lawyer. Someone was listening, there's no way.  
Me: And. When I say really crazy. Some of. The things that people. Have. The audacity to. Actually ask. You. If a lawyer. Someone was listening. There's. No way. Really?  
Them: That would fly. I mean, people ask. Let's blatant. You ask, asking about age and.  
Me: People ask. Blatant. You asking about? Age. Oh, wow.  
Them: Tenure and, like, just a lot of things.  
Me: 10. Ure. Just a lot of things.  
Them: Which. I mean, look, I go, you want to know somebody, especially if you're trying to hire a guy.  
Me: Which. I mean, look. You. Want to know somebody. Especially if you're trying to hire. A guy.  
Them: For, like a quarter million, $350,000 job. You want to know what they're all about? If you want to know what they know, you want the interview to.  
Me: Or. Like a quarter. Million three hundred and fifty thousand. Dollars job. You want to. Know what they're all about. You want to know and think. You want? To interview.  
Them: Give you the information that to make you feel good about bringing this person on.  
Me: To. Give you the information. To make you feel. Good about. Bringing this? Person on.  
Them: Because hiring someone for that, it being bad, could cost you a lot more money.  
Me: Because. Hiring someone for that. And. It being bad. Could cost. You a lot more money.  
Them: And the company, and it's a costly mistake if they make it. And I think there's a couple of things. I think companies are very leery of taking any sort of performative risk on employees. Now, if you smell of any risk, whether it's Scott's just trying to tack onto his retirement, for five years, which was insinuated many times.  
Me: And the. Company. And. It's. A costly. Mistake. If they make. It. And I think there's. A couple of things. I think. Companies are very leery. Of. Taking. Any sort of. Performative risk. On, employ. Ees. If. You smell of any risk. Whether. It's. Scottish trying to. Tackle into his retirement for. Five years, which was insinuated. Many times. Really?  
Them: Oh, God. You work for hedge fund that long? Do you even need to work? Why do you want to work? I was like,  
Me: Oh, God. You work for? Hedge fund that long. Do you even need to work? Why do you want to work?  
Them: I need to work. I have two kids yet to get out of college.  
Me: I. Need to work. I have two. Kids yet to get out of. College. Right.  
Them: What do I need to tell you? I mean, most people.  
Me: What do I need to tell you? I mean. Most people.  
Them: I was like, I'm 52 now. This is when I was like, 49, 50 years old. I was like, are you serious? I mean, you think 49, 50 years old, you think I'm ready to hang it up?  
Me: I'm. 52. Now, this is. When I was, like, 49. 50 years old. I was like, are you serious? I mean. You think? 49, 50 years old, you think I'm ready to hang it? Up.  
Them: I mean, it'd be great if I won the lottery or something.  
Me: It. 'd be great if I won the lottery. Or something. Right.  
Them: But I'm looking right at it. That hasn't happened.  
Me: Yeah, I'm looking. I'm 45. And I've already felt ageism significantly in my own search, so I can only imagine it's got to be worse. Yeah, that's crazy. I know we're already over from the 15 minutes I asked you for, so I apologize for going over, but I hope that was okay. You're not bothering me. Yeah, I got probably. Let's see. I think we've covered everything I wanted. The last question was we're kind of like, based on. What you said. We don't want to create another app. What we're trying to do is connect people in local communities with each other, basically almost doing, like, think about it like, professional matchmaking.  
Them: No, you're not bothering me.  
Me: Where two people meet each other in any kind of context, and we can kind of be in the middle to say, oh, you should talk to this person. We do that introduction and then let them go off and talk. But to do that, we're trying to figure out what existing platforms that we can tap into. And I was wondering, from a messaging perspective, what messaging tools are you typically using? Is it just SMS or is it like, are using WhatsApp or anything like that? Any other chat tools that you're using to talk to people?  
Them: I mean, we have, like, we have a. An app that we use, like, within our little companies, but that's not public. That's just, like, a private little network.  
Me: We have. An app that we. Use. Within our little company. But. That's not public. That's just like. A private little network.  
Them: I would say we use some slack. Not really internally, but with some of our vendors.  
Me: I would. Say. We. Use some slack? Not really. Internally, but. With some of our vendors.  
Them: Especially our warehouse and office thing. We have an office space?  
Me: Especially. Our warehouse. And office thing. We have an office space.  
Them: Where we meet. And we store a lot of the things like we prebiotic light fixtures and plumbing fixtures and things like that, put them in that space.  
Me: Where? We. Meet. And we store. A lot of the things. Like we. Prebiot light fixtures. And plumbing fixtures and things. Like that. Put them in that. Space.  
Them: So we communicate via Slack with them and a couple of other people that are on that channel.  
Me: So we. Can communicate via Slack with them. And a couple of other people. That are. On that channel.  
Them: Mostly sms we have.  
Me: Mostly. Sms. We.  
Them: A work channel that we keep open.  
Me: Have a work channel. That we keep up. In. And.  
Them: And most vendors are comfortable with that. Or. Or you just. They're old school. Just call them.  
Me: Most vendors. Are comfortable with. That. They're. Old school, just call them. Yeah, okay.  
Them: But. Yeah. I mean, nothing crazy like we don't really delve into WhatsApp or. Or any of those other signal app, whatever.  
Me: Nothing crazy. We don't really. Delve into. WhatsApp. Or any of. Those other signal app, whatever.  
Them: The other ones are.  
Me: Other. Ones are. All right. Yeah. That answers all my questions I had for you. Again, I really appreciate the time I spent with me today. I don't have much to offer in return, so I appreciate it.  
Them: No worries.  
Me: And I just wanted to express my gratitude. So thank you very much. It was nice to meet you. And if I ever need anything that I can be of assistance with, feel free to ask.  
Them: Yeah. Nice. Nice to meet you, Jake. Thanks. And let me. Let this all goes. Be interesting to see, but. Yeah, I mean, obviously removing the slop factor and connecting people who. Who need to talk and can share expertise and share stories.  
Me: Nice to meet you, Jake. Thanks. And let me go on this whole goes. Be interesting to see, but yeah, I mean, obviously, removing the slot factor. And connecting people who need to talk and can share expertise and share stories.  
Them: And maybe share places to land. Because, I mean, I don't, if. If I'm honest with you.  
Me: And maybe share places to land, because if I'm honest with you,  
Them: i don't think the job market has gotten any easier i think if i were to unplug myself from what i'm doing now and put myself back out there i  
Me: I don't. Think the job market has gotten any easier. I think if I were to. Unplug myself. From what I'm doing now and put. myself back out there
