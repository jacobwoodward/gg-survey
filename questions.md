# Good Growth Validation Interview Guide

Questions mapped to Proofboard components. Every answer moves a score.

---

## Interview Principles

- Ask about their life, not your idea (Mom Test style)
- Get specific stories, not hypotheticals ("Tell me about the last time...")
- Listen for intensity of pain, not just presence of pain
- Understand current workarounds and what they've already tried
- Don't pitch. Don't sell. Just listen.
- Every answer should move a Proofboard component up or trigger a pivot signal

## Student / Early-Career Professional

**Goal:** Validate "Resume Black Hole" pain. Test Zero-Interface acceptance. Confirm local value.

**Kill Signal:** They just want a better job board, not relationships/mentorship.

---

### Pain Point
*Level 2 → Target: Level 3*

**Questions:**
1. Walk me through your job search. What's that been like day to day?
2. Tell me about the last job you were excited about. What happened when you applied?
3. How many applications have you submitted in the last few months? How many led to a conversation with an actual person?
4. What's the most frustrating part of the whole process?
5. When you think about finding a job, what keeps you up at night?

**Listen for:** Emotional intensity. Specific stories, not generalizations. Signs of desperation or resignation.

---

### Existing Solution
*Level 2 → Target: Level 3*

**Questions:**
1. What are you doing right now to try to stand out?
2. What tools or platforms are you using? What's working, what isn't?
3. Have you tried networking? What did that actually look like?
4. Have you used LinkedIn to find opportunities? What's that experience been like?

**Listen for:** Named tools and specific frustrations. Workarounds they've invented. What they've given up on.

---

### Desired Outcome
*Level 2 → Target: Level 3*

**Questions:**
1. If you could wave a magic wand, what would be different about how you find opportunities?
2. Have you ever gotten an opportunity through someone you knew? Tell me about that.
3. What would "help" actually look like for you right now?

**Listen for:** Do they want efficiency (more applications faster) or relationships (warm intros, mentorship)? This is critical.

---

### Proposed Solution (Zero-Interface)
*Level 1 → Target: Level 3*

**Questions:**
1. What if there was a platform that worked entirely through text messages and calendar invites? No app to download, no new password to remember. What's your reaction to that?
2. Would you be comfortable receiving texts from a platform that's helping you connect with mentors and employers?
3. How do you feel about connecting your calendar so meetings could be booked automatically?

**Listen for:** Genuine interest vs. confusion vs. rejection. Watch body language. Hesitation about permissions is a red flag.

---

### Differentiators (Local Value)
*Level 1 → Target: Level 3*

**Questions:**
1. How important is it to you that job opportunities are local vs. remote?
2. Do you feel connected to any professional community in Buffalo right now?
3. If you could build relationships with employers and mentors specifically in Buffalo, would that be more or less valuable than connecting with people anywhere?

**Listen for:** Strong preference for local, or indifference. If they don't care about local, our core differentiator may not resonate.

---

### Kill Signal Test
*Level 2 → Target: Level 3*

**Questions:**
1. If a platform just made it easier to apply to more jobs faster, would that solve your problem?
2. What would actually need to change for your situation to improve?

**Listen for:** If they say "yes, just help me apply faster," that's a kill signal. We're not building a job board.

---

## Mentor / Advisor

**Goal:** Validate "Impact Void" pain. Confirm friction is the real blocker. Test Zero-Interface.

**Kill Signal:** They say "I just don't have time" with no nuance. Friction isn't actually the blocker.

---

### Pain Point
*Level 2 → Target: Level 3*

**Questions:**
1. Have you ever mentored someone, formally or informally? Tell me about that experience.
2. Is giving back or mentoring something you think about? What draws you to it?
3. What's stopped you from doing more of it?
4. Do you ever feel guilty about not helping more people? What's behind that feeling?

**Listen for:** Is it genuinely friction (scheduling, finding people) or is it something else (time, motivation, unclear value)?

---

### Existing Solution
*Level 2 → Target: Level 3*

**Questions:**
1. How do people typically find you when they want help or advice?
2. Have you ever used a formal mentorship program? What was that like?
3. When someone does reach out cold, what's the most annoying part of that interaction?
4. What do you do when you want to help but you're not the right person for their question?

**Listen for:** Specific frustrations with current channels. Are they drowning in bad-fit requests? Or do they get no requests at all?

---

### Desired Outcome
*Level 2 → Target: Level 3*

**Questions:**
1. Think about the best mentoring experience you've had, either giving or receiving. What made it work?
2. If it was easy to find exactly the right person to help, someone who actually needed what you have to offer, would you do it more often?
3. How much time would you realistically give to mentoring if the friction was removed?

**Listen for:** Enthusiasm when describing good experiences. Concrete time commitments they'd make.

---

### Proposed Solution (Zero-Interface)
*Level 1 → Target: Level 3*

**Questions:**
1. What if a platform matched you with people who needed your specific expertise, introduced you via text message, and let them book time directly on your calendar?
2. Would you be comfortable with that kind of automated introduction?
3. How would you feel about a system that tracked the outcomes of your mentorship over time, so you could see if your advice actually helped?

**Listen for:** Excitement about reduced friction, or concern about loss of control. Interest in impact tracking is a positive signal.

---

### Differentiators (Local Value)
*Level 1 → Target: Level 3*

**Questions:**
1. Does it matter to you whether the person you're helping is in Buffalo or could be anywhere?
2. Do you feel more invested in helping people locally? Why or why not?
3. Is there something about building up your local community that appeals to you?

**Listen for:** Emotional connection to local community, or pragmatic indifference.

---

### Target ROI (Impact Visibility)
*Level 1 → Target: Level 3*

**Questions:**
1. Do you ever wonder if the advice you give actually helps?
2. Would it matter to you to see the outcome of your mentorship over time?
3. What would it mean to you to have a record of the impact you've had?

**Listen for:** Desire for feedback loop. If they don't care about tracking impact, that feature may not resonate.

---

## Employer / Hiring Manager

**Goal:** Validate "Pipeline Gap" pain. Test willingness to pay. Confirm value of trajectory over resume.

**Kill Signal:** They're happy with their current recruiting stack. Pain isn't urgent.

---

**Questions:**
1. Think about your best hire. How did you find them? What made them great?
2. If you could see someone's trajectory over time, their contributions, how they show up in a community, how they've grown, would that change how you evaluate them?
3. What would make you trust a candidate more before you ever talk to them?

**Listen for:** Interest in signal beyond resumes. Value placed on community involvement and growth trajectory.

---

### Proposed Solution (Zero-Interface)
*Level 1 → Target: Level 3*

**Questions:**
1. What if you could see candidates who've been active in the Buffalo professional community, with a record of their contributions, mentorship, and growth over time?
2. Would that kind of visibility into someone's trajectory be more valuable than a traditional resume?
3. How would you feel about getting warm introductions to candidates through a local network, rather than cold applications?

---

## Program Director

**Goal:** Validate "Data Blindness" pain. Confirm need for engagement data (not just attendance). Test willingness to pay >$3k/year.

1. Tell me about the programs you run. What are you trying to accomplish?
2. How do you measure success today?

---

### Proposed Solution (Zero-Interface)
*Level 1 → Target: Level 3*

**Questions:**
1. What if participants could engage through text messages and calendar invites, and all that activity was automatically tracked and reported to you?

3. Would you pay $3,000 a year for a tool that could prove your program's value to funders?

**Listen for:** Specific dollar amounts. "Yes, absolutely" vs. hesitation on $3k. This is a kill criterion.

---

### Kill Signal Test
*Level 2 → Target: Level 3*

**Questions:**
1. Is attendance tracking enough for your funders, or do they want to see deeper engagement?
2. If you could only show that people showed up, would that be sufficient to justify your program?

## Red Flags (Kill Signals Across All Personas)

- Students who just want "more job listings" or "easier applications" (they want a job board, not relationships)
- Mentors who say "I just don't have time" without any nuance (friction isn't the real blocker)
- Program Directors who say attendance tracking is enough for their funders (they don't actually need engagement data)
- Employers who are happy with their current recruiting stack (pain isn't urgent)
- Anyone who seems uncomfortable with SMS or calendar-based interactions (Zero-Interface model won't work for them)

---

## Green Flags (Validation Signals)

- Emotional intensity when describing the problem
- Specific stories of frustration, not just general complaints
- Already trying workarounds (shows they care enough to act)
- Leaning forward when you hint at the solution direction
- Asking "when can I use this?" or "how do I sign up?"
- Budget owners who can name a specific dollar amount they'd pay
